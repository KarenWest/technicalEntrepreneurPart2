1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,529
Let's welcome Drew Houston. All right.

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:12,779
Can you guys hear me okay?

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,669
Good. So it's really a pleasure to be here and surreal

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,509
for me in a couple of different ways,

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,379
but a big turning point on kind of my whole entrepreneurial

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,499
adventure was actually about five years ago, maybe six years ago.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,689
There is this thing called startup school,

8
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,719
which is held in an auditorium not too far from here.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,929
So it's been a pretty crazy journey since then

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,714
that I hope to tell you guys a little about.

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,009
And so what I want to talk about is first and

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,399
foremost a little bit of the Dropbox story,

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,724
especially the early days and how we got started.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,709
And maybe thread through there,

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,339
some of the lessons you can draw from that

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,649
and when I was embarking on this journey,

17
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,729
it was actually I graduated with my undergrad degree

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,784
in computer science about six years ago.

19
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,729
So, it hasn't been that long,

20
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,509
but it would have been awesome if like someone sat

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,729
me down and told me what the journey would be like.

22
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,769
So, I'm trying to think of this in kind of those terms,

23
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,299
what do I wish, someone had told me when I was,

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,319
21, 22 just getting started because it was a pretty kind

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,269
of - well you sort of - what I was thinking about the whole

26
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,879
startup world was kind of like climbing mountain doom,

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,189
right, you don't know how tall it is,

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,539
but there is a lot of fire and things exploding all around you,

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,454
a lot of smoke and it's really steep and,

30
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,009
you know, even if you know where you're going right

31
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,349
now things are going to get gnarly down the road.

32
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,259
So, if I can do anything to kind of

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,109
demystify some of the process too,

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,599
I hope I can do that. So, thanks again. A little bit about me.

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,964
So I grew up as little kid I was programming computers.

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,484
Studied computer science in MIT,

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,969
I've learned not to fight those kinds of battles,

38
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:05,549
but, it is the Stanford of the East I guess you could call it.

39
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,609
And that was really kind of the beginning and one thing

40
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,109
I realized there was I had been programming for a while,

41
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,829
so actually I felt I had a pretty good

42
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,579
handle on the building part of things.

43
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,099
But then I was really fascinated by the world of business too

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,849
and throughout high school and college I had worked at a bunch

45
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,599
of different startups and more than anything else working at

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,849
a startup was the most kind of informative experience for me,

47
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,999
the thing that prepared me best for this kind of whole

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,049
journey and that was a little counterintuitive because

49
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,969
especially if you go to a competitive school,

50
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,399
you grow up and life is all about checking these boxes right?

51
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,669
First you got and you go get the right test scores,

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,959
you got to get the right GPA,

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,389
you got to do these different things to kind

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,729
of be prepared and sort of look good,

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,314
be good enough to be admitted into a good school.

56
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,039
And so if you kind of carry that logic forward you imagine that

57
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,659
the right path to startups would be something like well,

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,309
what got me here was checking out these boxes and I can

59
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,239
think of all kinds of other boxes that I should check

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,919
off before I'm like really ready to start a company.

61
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,469
Among them maybe I should get a bunch of graduate degrees,

62
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,809
so I'm a really good engineer, maybe I should go get an MBA,

63
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,049
so I know about business, maybe I should go work at a big company,

64
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,069
or like a tech company like Google,

65
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,724
then maybe I should work at a medium company, then a small company,

66
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,559
then sometime in my 30s,

67
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,344
40s, 50s, I will be prepared to start a company.

68
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,379
And empirically, there is no,

69
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,029
I mean, one thing about this whole world

70
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,419
is a bunch of different paths to success,

71
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,739
but empirically it's sort of surprising that so many other companies,

72
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,579
you would think about in the hall of fame,

73
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,809
were started by people who were basically had

74
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,314
no idea what the hell they were doing either.

75
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,294
And so if you have that feeling,

76
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,649
it should be of some comfort that Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple,

77
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,824
all these things were started by first or second time entrepreneurs

78
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,319
who were really figuring it out along the way too.

79
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,738
And so don't be too daunted if you don't have all the answers,

80
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,999
but, one important part of the Dropbox story

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,729
began when one of my best friends, this guy name Adam - Adam Smith,

82
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,879
he started a company called Xobni and he got funding

83
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,829
from this group of people called Y Combinator.

84
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,594
And back then they were still doing it in Boston as well as

85
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,939
out here and I was literally camped out in his living room,

86
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,289
while he was working on his company.

87
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,459
And I had been working on a company,

88
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,709
I had bootstrapped of all things an SAT prep company,

89
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,719
sometime - starting sometime in 2004, and like most first efforts,

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,034
I had no idea what I was doing.

91
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,209
In retrospect I did all kinds of things wrong,

92
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,729
but the biggest thing that was illuminating was just - so what happened

93
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,149
with Adam was he got a little bit of funding in - at the beginning

94
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,564
of the summer and at the end of the summer he moved out here.

95
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,844
He moved out to - well, he moved up to the city,

96
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,719
to San Francisco, and suddenly he was

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,044
talking to like all these people,

98
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,009
billionaires and famous entrepreneurs that I only read about and

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,089
the next thing I know I get this phone call from him being like,

100
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,944
hey we just got like $5 million from Vinod Khosla,

101
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,354
and I was like oh my god!

102
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,684
And Adam and I were fraternity brothers at MIT and he was actually

103
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,709
my little brother and so kind of a stark contrast between,

104
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,229
you know, not - less than a year prior probably my best memories of

105
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,079
Adam were in our game room in our fraternity playing beer pong,

106
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,199
not exactly expecting to be wheelbarrowing

107
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,769
away millions of dollars of cash,

108
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,339
so I was like well - all right, if Adam can do it, I can too.

109
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:06,939
And so never underestimate some of the baser motivations and how they

110
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:13,829
can propel you forward or maybe as a more practical piece of advice.

111
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,019
There is some quote you're an average of your five closest friends.

112
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,079
So, it can really help to be in a place where your closest

113
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,569
friends are also interested in startups and you're all kind

114
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,449
of pushing each other forward in a good natured way,

115
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,519
but there is also an undercurrent of competition

116
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,609
that can really be helpful. So, I saw the experience that Adam went

117
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,639
through with Xobni and Y Combinator,

118
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,229
I was having sort of this - it helped me discover that I was kind

119
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,579
of having this crisis and it couldn't put a name to it,

120
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,109
but it is something like burn out where I've been working

121
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,129
on my SAT prep company for two or three years part time.

122
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,509
And while I was finishing up my degree and I was like,

123
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,119
I haven't even asked myself,

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,109
like in the best case scenario what happens,

125
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,594
and I'm sort of thinking like well,

126
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,209
best case scenario like I'm kind of like king of SAT

127
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,469
prep and I kind of imagine like a little cardboard,

128
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,554
Burger King crown of something.

129
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,179
So I'm like - I'm not even really excited about

130
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,099
that because like there is not really - I mean,

131
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,479
there - I mean I love standardized testing as

132
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,869
much as any hormonally balanced person can.

133
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,109
But I'm like this is probably not my calling,

134
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,639
so - and so I was like well,

135
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,184
okay I had spend so much time on this thing,

136
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,079
I should really think carefully about

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,719
what I do next and I was like okay,

138
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,659
it should really come down to a few things.

139
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,079
And one of them was it had to be something

140
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,619
that was deeply technical because at heart,

141
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,509
since I was a little - technology is what I really love and

142
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,049
I would love for whatever company I start to have technology

143
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,149
as kind of the core source of it's competitive advantage.

144
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,809
Two, is I wanted something that I could explain to normal

145
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,319
people in a bar or coffee shop or something and have them

146
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,499
vaguely know what I'm talking about and so there are lots

147
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,549
of interesting ideas that some elements of infrastructure,

148
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,679
software - enterprise software that kind of ruled that

149
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,319
out even though it was technical interesting.

150
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,909
And third was it had to be something that had a working business

151
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,879
model because actually this was kind of the height of Web 2.0,

152
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,309
it was all kind of back to eye balls and do different things,

153
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,899
but I didn't really understand how that works if,

154
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,499
you know, can kind of eventually get people to

155
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,458
pay for your stuff or at least four people,

156
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,264
or how ever many were in here.

157
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,019
So, it was a good exercise for me because then I was able to think

158
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,029
long and hard about what I did next and I found myself in this

159
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,549
really bizarre situation where the same way that like social or

160
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,369
mobile or local startups are kind of the fad right now.

161
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,729
In late 2006, early 2007 cloud storage,

162
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,809
or online storage startups were kind of the thing

163
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,789
that is like the startup cliche basically and so

164
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,209
on TechCrunch you would have these roundups,

165
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,449
so like okay here are the next 100 online storage companies

166
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,154
that have launched and it was just kind of a joke and,

167
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,399
but at the same time I had all these problems with this

168
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,679
because I had this company and all of our crown jewels

169
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,794
I had on this little thumb drive and I was always like

170
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,174
one stupid mistake away from disaster, right.

171
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,669
I would carry it like in my shorts and I would pull it out,

172
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,229
and the connector would be bent and I would like

173
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,109
pray that I could like bend it back softly,

174
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,209
but firmly enough so it would keep working.

175
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,379
And I would - I mean, these are all things that people would do,

176
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,129
I would still be emailing myself stuff,

177
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,929
I would still be carrying this thing around,

178
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,379
on my little leash and it just drove me nuts and I went

179
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,189
through Michael Arrington's articles and I tried all

180
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,559
100 other things and I found something interesting where

181
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,579
none of them really solved the problem for me,

182
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,324
even though there were a lot of them.

183
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,979
And in particular you had to get like one thing

184
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,229
to - one service that was like a website,

185
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,539
you could upload your stuff too and then you had get another

186
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,099
app that was like that would sync things across your computers

187
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,349
and you get another app to back up your computer and I'm

188
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,844
like as we would later tell investors like,

189
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,609
I mean, I can't really imagine Tom Cruise in Minority Report

190
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,129
like logging into his Gmail to like pick up the attachment he

191
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,579
sent himself that morning or like forgetting his thumb drive,

192
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,249
it was just over here and your stuff follows you round and

193
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,189
that's the whole point like someone else takes care of it.

194
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,829
And we had a glimpse of that at school and

195
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,619
I'm sure you guys have something similar,

196
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,134
we had this system called Athena,

197
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,499
where you sit down at any of tens of

198
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,549
thousands of computers across campus,

199
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,259
all your stuff's in front of you,

200
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,399
you don't think about it and it's kind of - it's not a

201
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,489
very - it's not a consumer kind of typical environment

202
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,759
so it's kind of Unix focused and things like that.

203
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,209
But still you're not like sprinting back

204
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,449
across campus to take up your paper,

205
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,859
you're not worried about backing it up because

206
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,429
again someone else was just taking care of it.

207
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,834
And nobody here really built that for the

208
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:12,169
rest of the world and like this was pre,

209
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,289
you know, iPhone and iPad and all the amazing things

210
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,964
that have happened in the last five years and it

211
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,279
wasn't actually a very mainstream use case,

212
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,699
I mean, people were not syncing things across like six Linux PCs,

213
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,054
even then most people just had one computer.

214
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,009
But anyways it drove me nuts enough where the kind of last straw

215
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,699
was - I was in Boston South Station at the Chinatown bus terminal

216
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,584
and if any of you had the pleasure of riding the Chinatown bus,

217
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,779
it costs like 10 or 15 bucks and it takes you from Boston to New York

218
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,259
and is famous for such things like tipping over or things like that.

219
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,219
So, fortunately that wasn't part of the story.

220
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,629
And I got to New York okay,

221
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,499
but there was a problem which is I had been making this mental

222
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,989
checklist of like all these great things that I was going

223
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,069
to get done because I had four hours in front of me where

224
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,889
nobody was going to bother me and here all the great things

225
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,569
I was kind of accomplish and I excitedly sit down,

226
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,829
I open up my, I guess,

227
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,304
ThinkPad at the time and I'm like I get that feeling in

228
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,429
the pit of my stomach which many of you have experienced

229
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,709
at one time or another where I was like start feeling around

230
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,379
in my pocket and I just get this vivid picture in my head

231
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:32,799
of my thumb drive sitting on my desk at home and,

232
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,689
you know, and then I'm like okay,

233
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,469
instead of getting all these wonderful things done,

234
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,739
I'm just going to think about what an

235
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,829
idiot I'm for the next four hours,

236
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,719
but thought for about 10 or 15 minutes,

237
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,679
but then actually open up the editor and started writing some

238
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,579
code having actually no idea what this would turn into,

239
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,609
but I'm getting so frustrated that nobody

240
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,174
had really solved this problem.

241
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,729
And so that was kind of the beginning of it and then through kind

242
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,849
of a interesting chain of events I met my cofounder Arash actually

243
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,839
put up a - I put up a screencast of Dropbox on Hacker News and Arash

244
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,899
actually saw it and it turned out one of the other things I did

245
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,869
on this trip out to California five years ago,

246
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:23,589
back in March 2007, was come out to meet a bunch of the Y Combinator founders

247
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,079
and complain how I didn't have a cofounder and it turned out,

248
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,439
I met someone who was a mutual friend of mine and Arash's and

249
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,979
he made an introduction to us and we met up at the MIT Student

250
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,239
Center and hung out for an hour or two and talked about MySQL

251
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,079
and some other things and Dropbox and they were like yeah,

252
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,859
of course we will like to spend all of our waking

253
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,874
hours together for the foreseeable future.

254
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,424
So kind of like getting married on the first date.

255
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,569
But, you know, if anything doesn't,

256
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,769
just an extraordinarily lucky break that ended

257
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,644
up working out and we ended up having all these

258
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,829
complementary skills and a great relationship,

259
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,554
but I would recommend getting to know, its not the safe way to do it,

260
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,049
but that's the one - probably the most important decision you make,

261
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,569
is who your cofounder is.

262
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,229
But anyway so, Arash and I applied to Y Combinator and we get in,

263
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,054
and we spend this blissful summer of doing nothing but waking up,

264
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,159
writing code till the sun goes down,

265
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,369
then it comes up again and then I would drive back and drop

266
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,469
him off at his dorm room at MIT and I would race home and

267
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,334
we would do it again probably for 90 days straight.

268
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,319
And so one of the great things about

269
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,649
Y Combinator is it kind of plugs you in,

270
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,869
it's sort of a startup boot camp where you encounter

271
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,839
all these classic characters that you meet out here,

272
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,229
work, you know, so here talks - there is,

273
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,474
all the program is really is weekly dinners,

274
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,119
and you have talks from entrepreneurs and lawyers,

275
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,959
investors, just all these different people,

276
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,719
and they kind of start giving you context

277
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,989
around what you need to know,

278
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,209
and one of the most challenging things as a founder is really you discover

279
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,139
very quickly that you know a lot about the technical founders,

280
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,969
you know a lot about the engineering,

281
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,979
but there is always other things you got to - you certainly have

282
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,269
to care about from sales to finance to management strategy,

283
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,479
like all these different things.

284
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,609
And one of the things I had done that was really valuable in college,

285
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,179
is during the summers I would go up on to the roof of our house

286
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,839
and I'd just go on Amazon and I would like search like sales

287
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,814
and l look for like the highest rated book on that,

288
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,509
and like buy it and do the same thing for all of those different

289
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,969
disciplines and it actually was absolutely instrumental in helping

290
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,909
me start to understand how all these things worked.

291
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,309
And you don't become a great salesperson by reading

292
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,539
a book any more than you become a great guitarist

293
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,899
or basketball player by reading a book.

294
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,179
But it can start to give you some sense of,

295
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,289
you know, for people that are really great at this,

296
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,399
what do they think about,

297
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,149
and this really kind of important kind of 80-20 aspect of

298
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,059
sort of learning the basics about a given discipline,

299
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,114
that was really helpful for me.

300
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,809
But anyway, so Y Combinator, this is this amazing experience,

301
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,499
and we moved out of Boston to San Francisco.

302
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,099
And to just give you a kind of flavor of the kinds of things

303
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,459
that you have to deal with when you're sort of trying to figure

304
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,049
all this out is through another series of events,

305
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,859
we got introduced to this venture firm called Sequoia Capital.

306
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,769
And it's the kind of thing where you walk into

307
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,669
the chalets a couple of miles away from here,

308
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,529
and for someone who never really spent much time in California

309
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,889
or never spent much time in the whole ecosystem it's pretty

310
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,889
daunting because you look and it's like okay,

311
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:54,079
there is like a picture of Steve Jobs and there is a - the original

312
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,379
Google S1 or the stock certificates from the IPO

313
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,039
and you are just like I don't really belong here,

314
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,524
I'm just like some - we're just a bunch,

315
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,999
couple of - Arash actually dropped out of school,

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,809
so he gets all the startup credit, but anyway so, there we are,

317
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,339
and we actually hit it off with the partner there,

318
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:22,449
and then through, sort of muddle our way through and I'm desperately

319
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,709
calling people at night asking for advice on fundraising,

320
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,034
different things through people I had met.

321
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,089
And somehow we found ourselves in a situation

322
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,489
where they decided to invest, and I'm like oh my God this is amazing,

323
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,139
and you know we're going through all this

324
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,099
process and it happened pretty quickly,

325
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,639
we showed up on a Friday, bit of handshake deal on Monday night,

326
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,684
so one business day turnaround, which was pretty convenient.

327
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,094
And then I had this new problem which was,

328
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,989
the finance people are like emailing me like

329
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,199
okay please send me your wiring instructions.

330
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,279
I'm like wiring instructions,

331
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,779
like the only training I had wiring instructions was,

332
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,549
I think that happened in like James Bond movies,

333
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,339
and I'm like I'm pretty sure we only have like the

334
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,889
"my first business" checking account from Bank of America

335
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,829
that we set up in the CambridgeSide Galleria Mall,

336
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,744
and I'm like so this might be tough.

337
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,819
So, Arash and I go to the North Beach branch of the Bank of America,

338
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,119
and we we're like well, so you got the teller people,

339
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,039
and you got the leather seat people, and we look at each other like,

340
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:34,319
it's probably a leather seat problem.

341
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,319
And we sit down and the woman was really nice,

342
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,329
she was like, how can I help you,

343
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,824
and I'm like is there a limit to how much a bank account can hold?

344
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,719
And she was like, well what do you mean?

345
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,309
And like I was dressed in shorts and a hoody

346
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,359
and Arash was even more disheveled,

347
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,589
and I'm like well, can it hold $1 million?

348
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,659
And she was like yeah,

349
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,639
and so, and I don't know if she thought it was like drugs

350
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,144
or this kind of thing happens all the time out here,

351
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,919
but both sides very quickly stopped asking questions and

352
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,034
we got our routing number and everything and went back,

353
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,579
but there is no like startup manual where you are like oh,

354
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,359
well here is how that works, and so a lot of it is really,

355
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,209
even when you look - at some of these amazingly successful companies

356
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,099
and having had a chance to meet a lot of those people,

357
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,619
so much of what makes startups crazy is just kind of this iterative

358
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,439
process of just having these random things happen to you,

359
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,714
or having these ideas and just kind of figuring it out.

360
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,464
And I talk about some of the kind of more humble beginnings

361
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,269
because I think there is this huge disservice that kind

362
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,799
of the - of the sort of Silicon Valley methodology,

363
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,374
and the things you read in magazines where it's like,

364
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,059
you know, right from the moment he was

365
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,899
sitting in his dorm room at Harvard,

366
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,784
Mark Zuckerberg sought to redefine the face of human communication.

367
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:10,999
And you know, and Google they were going to organize

368
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,689
all the world's information and all these different

369
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,294
things and you sort of sit there and you're like,

370
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,399
you're just trying to like write code and hope it compiles.

371
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,449
And you're like, well I know I'm not quite like that,

372
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,539
and I'm not thinking about that,

373
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,919
I'm thinking about like we have $60 left in our checking

374
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,704
account and I can't loan the company any more money.

375
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,499
So anyway, the point is like,

376
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,559
in fact Facebook it was number,

377
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,979
like project number seven or eight that Mark happened

378
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,329
to be hacking on and it just happened to sign up the

379
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,704
whole Harvard campus in a couple of weeks,

380
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:54,889
but and Google, like they were - they were rejected when they offered -

381
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,429
they wanted to sell the company for $1 million to Yahoo,

382
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,229
and so the point is,

383
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,619
all these things start with much more modest ambitions,

384
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,644
and even the sort of, the great entrepreneurs.

385
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,264
And the - as you sort of reach each of these new milestones,

386
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,159
you're like okay, the goalposts move back and so your

387
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,579
ambitions are going to be much broader over time,

388
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,789
and this is kind of - all this doesn't happen overnight.

389
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,229
So when you kind of look at - I talked at the beginning of

390
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,949
how kind of daunting everything seems because there is

391
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,179
like the little sort of corner of stuff that you know,

392
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,879
and this world of stuff that you don't - often that can be enough

393
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,659
of a barrier to stop people from even getting started.

394
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,639
So, just realize that this - that you have to be systematic

395
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,309
about how you learn all these things,

396
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,749
but this all happens one day at a time,

397
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,649
and so then there were a couple of other things that were

398
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,924
pretty instrumental in our - in the early years of Dropbox.

399
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,289
And one of them was really figuring out distribution.

400
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:59,979
And I think it's something that people kind of underestimate,

401
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,769
the importance of that. And it was especially interesting in our case

402
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,269
because we made a couple of mistakes.

403
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,509
One was like really kind of right,

404
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,209
we're launching this company and we should probably get real,

405
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,509
and like hire PR people and advertising

406
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,764
guys and different things and SEO,

407
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,039
buy AdWords and all this stuff, and so we bought a lot of AdWords,

408
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,429
and we spent a bunch of money and time

409
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,769
on this and the results were just terrible,

410
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,729
it cost us like $500 or $1,000

411
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,179
to acquire a user that was going to pay us $100 and so,

412
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,699
very clear that that wasn't going to work.

413
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,539
But we had actually done these more kind of guerilla things,

414
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,699
which was inspired by reading the book Guerilla Marketing which

415
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,574
was actually really instrumental in thinking about this,

416
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,289
where we put this video of Dropbox on Digg in 2007.

417
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,249
Sorry, March 2008, about a year after we started.

418
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,279
And what we managed to do is we put

419
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,759
all these little Easter eggs in it,

420
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,649
and because - and if you're familiar with the Digg,

421
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,989
or with Digg or Reddit are kind of these classic internet

422
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,449
communities and they have these little memes,

423
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,119
and things like that and it was just this deadpan

424
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,059
demo of me talking over a sort of a screen.

425
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,179
But the files were all named things,

426
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,259
like named after like Chocolate Rain

427
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,939
which is a YouTube sensation - well,

428
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,849
YouTube, one of these viral videos back in the day.

429
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,309
And it references office space and Obama

430
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,774
and xkcd and all these things.

431
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,699
But it was just me kind of deadpanning everything,

432
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,979
oh, this is how Dropbox works.

433
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,359
And the thing just like - and we put it - we get

434
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,244
a kind of a little bit of a link bait title,

435
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,084
I think it was Google Drive killer coming from MIT startup.

436
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,964
So, go big.

437
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:41,949
And so the thing just like absolutely took off,

438
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,989
it hit the top - it hit the top of Digg, it was like 12,000 Diggs,

439
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,749
hundreds of thousands of people visited

440
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,809
the - what used to be - getdropbox.com,

441
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,334
that was our first domain name, that's a whole other story.

442
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,579
But anyway, all these people visited the website

443
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,929
and like our beta waiting list went from 5,000

444
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,869
to 75,000 people overnight,

445
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,449
which is because we had been wringing our hands

446
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,219
about this kind of critical mass problem, and how do we get started,

447
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,719
and just that one kind of ghetto thing that

448
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,209
we did ended up working extremely well.

449
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,449
In fact, nothing well - it solved literally overnight,

450
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,814
our distribution problem or the at least the getting started problem.

451
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,449
And the lesson there is not to make a video and put it on Digg,

452
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,589
because that probably wouldn't work very well anymore,

453
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,219
but the - but really understand - there are

454
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,669
a couple of insights that came from that.

455
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,809
One is - another thing I learned from one these books,

456
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,289
called Crossing the Chasm is you have this technology adoption life

457
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,319
cycle and you have these people who - most people are not searching the

458
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,849
internet for like cool things that they can download on to their computer

459
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,059
or like want more buttons on their Blu-ray remote, right.

460
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,844
But there are some people who are like that,

461
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,559
and they're called early adopters and they kind

462
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,324
of seek out technology for its own sake.

463
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,319
And any service or any company has some kind of

464
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,394
early adopters whether it's fashion or cars or,

465
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,954
in our case it's really technology and kind of this tool,

466
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,989
or this utility, and Digg was - just happened to be

467
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,479
the kind of place where those people hung out,

468
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,339
and where those people would really take to something

469
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,679
like this even though they couldn't download it yet.

470
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,199
And so understanding our early customer was really valuable there,

471
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,734
and that's kind of - that's one way that we did that.

472
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,949
The other problem we discovered is that no one's

473
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,474
really searching for what we were building.

474
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,149
No one was like waking up in the middle of night,

475
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,339
you know like, oh my god,

476
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,059
I wish I didn't have to like email myself stuff,

477
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,149
or like carry it on the thumb drive,

478
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,714
that's just like how your computer works.

479
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,909
And I wish I had a washing machine I can put clothes in,

480
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,689
press a button, they're clean,

481
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,299
they come out but like I'm not like waking up the middle night,

482
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,729
you know, like man that really sucks, there's like this washer thing,

483
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,389
there is a dryer, and you have to like put it in one,

484
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:56,534
and wait, and put it in the other, but - that's just like how it works.

485
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,319
And so if - from that angle it's like well it doesn't matter how many,

486
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,849
you can buy all the AdWords in the world,

487
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,169
but if no-one's searching for what you're making then you have

488
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,639
a problem and so you have to find other ways of doing that.

489
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:16,709
And so the thing that really worked for us was first make a product

490
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,409
that people really love to use and there is all kinds of things,

491
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,459
elements that go into the craftsmanship and all these

492
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,199
little thousands of details that we had to sand down,

493
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,699
and all these things at some of the other companies didn't

494
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,784
really get quite right from an engineering standpoint.

495
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,359
But then if you're able to do that,

496
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,519
then Dropbox actually happened to fall in this category,

497
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,989
of sort of unusual category where it solves

498
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,539
a problem you don't even know you have,

499
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,729
and it actually works.

500
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,809
And unlike that Blu-ray player,

501
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,319
when you're just - all you're trying to do is like watch

502
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,959
Batman and you can't even plug it into your TV,

503
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,709
that's people's kind of average experience with technology,

504
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,964
and so one way to conceptualize what makes a good product is,

505
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,829
good engineering is part of it, good design is part of it,

506
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,289
but really it's - what I think about it,

507
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,849
at least is maximizing the probability that someone shows up at

508
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,969
the front door of your store or your website or whatever it is,

509
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,634
and ends up with a solved problem.

510
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,389
And that's why things like Craigslist, started in the '90s,

511
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,509
doesn't appear to have been updated since the '90s,

512
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,279
still by far the most successful website -

513
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,744
most successful business of its kind,

514
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,749
because you show up at craigslist.org

515
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,069
and you leave with your concert tickets or your casual encounter,

516
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,069
whatever you're looking for.

517
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,819
Even though the design isn't that great,

518
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,369
you know, maybe it's not that hard of an engineering problem,

519
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,584
different things, it's unbelievably successful.

520
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,479
So, anyway it starts with a good - in my opinion

521
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,869
it really starts with a great product,

522
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,974
and all the marketing or tricks in the world,

523
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:59,379
it's - you're not going to push a rock uphill.

524
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,239
And then the second thing where we - so once we understood that,

525
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,619
then it made it a lot easy for us to conceptualize this.

526
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,709
And so what we did instead, we were like okay, well we have all these

527
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,264
people who appear to really love Dropbox,

528
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,609
and the only reason we're like succeeding at all,

529
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,869
beside this sort of Digg maneuver we did in the beginning,

530
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,639
is because they're telling their friends about it.

531
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,764
So why don't we just like harness that?

532
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,544
And how can we get people tools to spread the word?

533
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:30,829
And so what we did was two things that drive the vast majority

534
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,069
of our - all of our traffic today or all of our sign ups,

535
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,789
which are one, we made this Incentive Referral

536
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,209
Program where if I tell you about Dropbox,

537
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,559
you get some extra space and I get some extra space,

538
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,584
and we have this kind of currency to work with,

539
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,289
and people were just doing that kind of for its own sake,

540
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,439
where people weren't even using that extra space,

541
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,249
they were just referring to friends because they like,

542
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:50,969
it's like points, right.

543
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,829
It's this whole - what we'd now call kind of a gamification

544
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,299
mechanic even though we didn't - I don't know if that

545
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,949
even - that word had been around back then,

546
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,749
but that's what it happened to be,

547
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,499
and then the other thing is we created this idea of shared folders,

548
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,469
where if I'm working on a project at work,

549
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,419
or I want to share these photos with my family,

550
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,929
then all these new - all these users are just by using the product,

551
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,684
you get bought into the fold.

552
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,929
And there is this whole,

553
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,569
you know, now there is this whole body of art and science on how to do

554
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,779
that and how consumer net companies grow and how viral growth works.

555
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,009
But anyway, it was - these things were

556
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,179
instrumental to how we got started.

557
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,299
And so there's all kind of things I could say about,

558
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,339
sort of the intervening years,

559
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,509
and sort of like the one of the frustrating things

560
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,279
about giving a talk that's like a half hour,

561
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,544
it's like you have to omit,

562
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,139
it's like the montage where you know Rocky's punching

563
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,769
or whatever and suddenly you're like,

564
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,799
you know, I don't know but then obvious -

565
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:59,679
but you're making a good product, finding ways to get distribution.

566
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,849
Then the last thing I'll really touch on is,

567
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,619
because I had a chance to ask Mike Morris,

568
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,189
like what really separates the great companies from

569
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,229
other companies that are out there in technology?

570
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,929
And he was like, one is he said, hiring the best engineers,

571
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,809
and two, the founders having a morbid fascination with the product.

572
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,009
And I'm not even going to try to do the whole Welsh accent thing,

573
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,439
but those two things will carry you a long way,

574
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,904
and then I'm sure he would add having a really big market

575
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,139
and all the other things that matter in a business.

576
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,209
But probably the most amazing thing for me is when it works out,

577
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,849
and the thing that attracted me to this

578
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,254
in the first place was really kind of,

579
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,789
never - like having a high learning curve,

580
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,009
so that part is taken care of,

581
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:53,889
is always, you're never bored there's never things to

582
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,539
- never a shortage of things to worry about or that are new.

583
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,009
But what's really exciting is now we

584
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,689
have this - from the starting point,

585
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,159
we have the canvas we're painting on as we've gone

586
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,509
from millions of users a couple of years ago,

587
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,569
to tens of millions of users, you know, soon we'll have a very clear

588
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,179
path to hundreds of millions of users.

589
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,119
Of all the people that have thought about kind

590
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,219
of like building the internet file system,

591
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,099
or this fabric that kind of connects all the

592
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,979
world's devices and services and apps.

593
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,969
We are actually the ones who get to build it,

594
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,929
and when you think about someone who builds things,

595
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,959
and who studies computer science,

596
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,689
you're probably not going to go to Super Bowl,

597
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,379
probably not going to be in Hollywood, in movies, but so for this,

598
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,839
this really is the Super Bowl and when it works out,

599
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,949
and you actually sit down,

600
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,459
you're like - you look over someone's shoulder at

601
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,849
a Starbucks and see a little blue box or you add up,

602
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,479
this many millions of people or tens of millions

603
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,269
of people or hundreds or millions of people,

604
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,104
time saving them like 10 minutes,

605
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,239
are making their life like 1% better or whatever,

606
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,119
suddenly it's like okay,

607
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,529
it's like lifetimes of pain that we're saving people every day.

608
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:10,549
And then it's just - this is the most like amazing path to actually,

609
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,589
you know, if it all works out, actually changing the world.

610
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,749
So, I promised to leave time for Q&A,

611
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,699
so I guess we will leave it at that.

612
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:33,709
How do you fend off competitors, like now Google Drive and SkyDrive?

613
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,869
Could you repeat the question? Yeah.

614
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,879
The question is how do you fend off competitors,

615
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,929
especially when they're the largest internet companies in the world.

616
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,789
We think about that from time to time.

617
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,699
The - another sort of bias is you always

618
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,349
kind of overestimate competition,

619
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:03,859
not that it should be underestimated, but for companies like ours,

620
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,784
and you think about any company that has gotten to sort of

621
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,979
- plenty of stories of companies where they got a really

622
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,494
great headstart and then somehow things went south.

623
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,749
You know, Netscape or MySpace or there are bunch of

624
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,379
companies that you could say fall in this category,

625
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,254
and when you talk to people in those companies,

626
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,289
there is a very clear trend, which is that suicide is a much more

627
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,199
common cause of death than homicide,

628
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:41,819
meaning often there is a - companies are getting built

629
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,579
faster than ever like in the history of the world.

630
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,089
And so along with that kind of hyper growth are

631
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,014
all these different cancers that you can get,

632
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,659
and so things are going to go wrong, you know.

633
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,509
My favorite analogy on this was Marc Andreessen and he is like okay,

634
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,479
so he was trying to build a bigger cake in five minutes.

635
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,739
Like no matter how good you are,

636
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,589
you've had egg on the ceiling there is stuff on the walls,

637
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,539
you can just pray when you pull the cake out,

638
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,104
maybe it's a little bit lopsided you can kind like squish it back.

639
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,749
But like if you forget the eggs, or you forget the sugar,

640
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,319
you can't like sprinkle them on later.

641
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:16,644
So, how do you figure out the stuff,

642
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:21,139
or how do you figure out what stuff you can't fix later.

643
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,749
I will come back to the competition thing in a second,

644
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,739
sorry for such a tangent.

645
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,509
And so, often what happens at those companies that screwed up,

646
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,199
if you talk to people inside them, they're like, well we - just,

647
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,249
we lost our focus or we hired people that weren't as good,

648
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,399
and then the talented people we got in the beginning looked

649
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,659
around and they were like I'm tired of fixing this person's

650
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,939
bugs or that they don't work as hard or all this stuff,

651
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,989
and life is short, I'm a talented person,

652
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,669
I want to go find the place that has a lot of talented people.

653
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:55,379
So, actually the point about hiring the very best

654
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,269
people is something we spend a ton of time on,

655
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,579
because that's again - that's the thing you can't sprinkle on later,

656
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,069
if you ever lose it, it's gone.

657
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,939
And then the other is really distraction,

658
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,929
some pretty heartbreaking stories out there

659
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,549
of companies that were really promising,

660
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,944
but then either start trying to do too many things or

661
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,319
Friendster the - that the founder complaining that his board

662
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,549
was trying to get him to chase all these deals with MTV

663
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,899
and all these like shiny objects when he is like,

664
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,959
guys the site won't even load,

665
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,529
it like - takes like 10 seconds for the web page to show up.

666
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,399
And so the power of focus is - the focus is really powerful.

667
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,229
And again, you try to figure out those elements as you sort of

668
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,769
start from like just coding to like designing and designing systems

669
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,969
of code and algorithms to designing systems of people,

670
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,899
and figuring out the things that other companies

671
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,689
have learned about that along the way.

672
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,119
And, so while it's something that's

673
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,279
really important to keep track of, you know, most of it,

674
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,099
if you actually look at all the data points it's

675
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,439
really more often the problems begin at home,

676
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,809
not because of some competition.

677
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,259
And so how - the way we will respond,

678
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,599
the kind of way we are responding,

679
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,389
competition is actually very little is changing,

680
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,039
like nothing in our roadmap actually changed.

681
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,154
Maybe a couple of things that got reordered,

682
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,084
but we just focus on maximizing the number of happy Dropbox users,

683
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,469
and figuring out problems, more problems, that people don't even know

684
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,759
they have and solving them, right.

685
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,379
So, lots of - we are never going to run out of examples of that, right.

686
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,929
You know you look at your iPhone,

687
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,099
and you're like wow it has like a whatever

688
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,089
megapixel camera and it takes HD video,

689
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,394
but then you know, how do I see that on my Samsung TV,

690
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,489
or why is it that - oh my god this is - I just discovered

691
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,549
I left my iPhone in a cab and now like oh my newborn

692
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,239
kid's pictures are like gone forever,

693
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,769
like it's a problem you never had to worry about before.

694
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,139
And so we think a lot about what kinds of problems

695
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,539
that people don't even know they have, and think about solving them,

696
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,529
and we think we're the only people that

697
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,509
really think about it this way and so,

698
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,489
keeping our users happy and hiring the best people,

699
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,959
those are the two main things,

700
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,549
and you can screw up all kinds of other

701
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,119
stuff if you get those two right.

702
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,599
How do you make good business decisions?

703
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:16,579
That's kind of a hard - it's a hard question to answer.

704
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,859
I think for - so there the question is how

705
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,499
do you make good business decisions,

706
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:27,119
and it's a kind of a hard question to provide a

707
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,909
pithy answer like how do you play guitar well.

708
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,449
I mean, there's a lot - there is a bunch of things going in,

709
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,049
it's a good question, but I think it's really about prioritizing

710
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,539
those things and thinking about just that,

711
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,119
how we get the best people into the company,

712
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,469
how do we build a great product, how we make our users really happy.

713
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,569
And then, especially as a first time CEO, how do, you have to,

714
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,039
like it was really helpful to me to just try and really

715
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,254
research how all of these companies worked, especially on the way up.

716
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,929
How did Google work, how did - and not just like internet companies,

717
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,879
how did Intel work, how did companies in the '70s work,

718
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,849
I mean what was the kind of - learned - kind of get as many lenses

719
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,349
on these different things from a - to view things from the sales

720
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,619
lens or a behavioral psychology lens or a management lens,

721
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,269
all these different things,

722
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,789
and so bringing those different kinds of perspectives -

723
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,399
giving yourself context around those things,

724
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,149
and having a lot of tools to kind of

725
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,369
deal with any business situation,

726
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:25,039
I think are one framework for making good decisions.

727
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,459
And hiring good - like great people into the

728
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,394
company that can help you with that stuff.

729
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,804
Could you tell a little more about the investment process like,

730
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,079
the first time you got investment from Sequoia,

731
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,359
was it like a no brainer,

732
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,239
did they offer, did you take whatever they offered to you,

733
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,699
negotiate or was it very simple? It's complicated.

734
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,199
I mean there is a lot of stuff,

735
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,069
that's sort of one of these - it's kind of a classic kind of pitfall

736
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:56,104
thing that you can spend a ton of time worrying about.

737
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,289
And - but I'm sure any venture capitalist

738
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,549
- you could be the worst negotiator in the world,

739
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,649
but if you're like, god, we're just getting so much traffic,

740
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,709
we just need money for servers, like can you please,

741
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,684
and we have all these people who are using it,

742
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,939
we just need some money,

743
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,359
you're going to get some pretty good venture capital investment

744
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,539
if that's the problem you actually have and how do you do that?

745
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,369
You get traction.

746
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,579
And so there is a whole body of knowledge on that,

747
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,794
it's actually pretty well spelled out in venturehacks.com

748
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,289
is the - is where I learned and I think

749
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,489
is probably the best site out there,

750
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,679
that goes over the nuts and bolts of venture investment

751
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,179
and a bunch of other interesting stuff.

752
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,249
Drew, fantastic service first of all,

753
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,674
I've been addicted to Dropbox for the last two years in grad school,

754
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,459
use it every day of my life and it's been fantastic. Thank you.

755
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,319
My question that leads up to that,

756
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,359
my usage is that I'm at my 5GB and I'm the

757
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,739
guy who doesn't like to pay for services,

758
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,259
that's the proof of the matter, right.

759
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,699
I do that from Netflix for $7.99

760
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,209
and that's pretty much it, and I try to feign the payment.

761
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,199
So what I do is I tell my mom to join,

762
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,079
my dad to join, who don't know anything about technology,

763
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,079
they're not going to be using Dropbox any time soon.

764
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,159
So how do you make this happen, because I'm kind of,

765
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,419
for now I'm actually using Amazon Drive,

766
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,574
I'm using a little bit of Microsoft, and I'm using Dropbox.

767
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,529
How do you get people to pay money and make money for

768
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,689
your business because valuations are all right,

769
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,349
but money needs to come in? Question is how do we actually convince

770
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,829
people to pay for what we're making?

771
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:32,069
And actually even for Dropbox

772
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,199
as it is - there is all kinds of ways that,

773
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,479
that you can use the service without actually paying for it.

774
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,314
And then there are even things you can do around,

775
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:46,189
using a sort of putting this stuff on Amazon, this stuff on Google,

776
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,169
this stuff on Dropbox and so on.

777
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,909
I mean, our fundamental value proposition is that

778
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,929
like we keep all of your stuff in one place and

779
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,919
we do a better job with that than anybody else,

780
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,799
and we have - you're free to not have

781
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,109
to worry about all this stuff like,

782
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,459
you know, is it going to work with my phone,

783
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,929
is it going to work with my computer,

784
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,639
we support all these different platforms,

785
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,409
and provide - what we hope is a uniformly great experience.

786
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:16,599
And a lot of people just want to solve problem and rather

787
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,089
than going to all that trouble of sort of partitioning

788
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,674
your stuff across all these different places,

789
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,694
that's actually the point of Dropbox is to bring it all together,

790
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,489
and they would rather have that than $10 a month or $100 a year.

791
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,169
So, fortunately that goes back to the technology and option curve,

792
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,269
like some people just - people just have different

793
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,079
proclivities for like paying for things or not,

794
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,894
and so we just make sure that we're solving a problem that's

795
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,259
big enough for people that would rather pay for it than just

796
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,129
then have to like deal with all these other hurdles.

797
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,779
Do you see enough people paying for it?

798
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,289
Yes, the paid services are popular and I can't - I make

799
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,624
everybody else be quiet about that, so I have to too.

800
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,969
Can you tell us about a few of the things that crossed

801
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:06,529
your path that you guys decided not to go with?

802
00:42:06,629 --> 00:42:08,246
The things that seemed like good ideas

803
00:42:08,346 --> 00:42:10,601
but then you decided to discard them.

804
00:42:11,981 --> 00:42:16,157
So the question is, are the things that seemed like

805
00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:18,714
a promising path that we decided not to do,

806
00:42:18,814 --> 00:42:21,149
there are all kinds of things.

807
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,149
I mean that is almost the essence of what makes the job difficult.

808
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,369
There is these thousands of things that we could go do,

809
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:31,439
and all these shiny objects and usually most of the things,

810
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,189
we look back on and like that was a dead end,

811
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:37,169
a lot of them, we tried to get Dropbox sort of preinstalled on PCs,

812
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,819
and all these different things and do deals very early on,

813
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:45,069
and the problem was just sort of classic negotiation,

814
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,799
we had no leverage.

815
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,979
So they're going to just push us around,

816
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,209
they made all these ridiculous demands,

817
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,859
and we kind of, it's like harpooning this whale,

818
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,029
it is like taking you all over the place.

819
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,349
And now it's a completely different story,

820
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:04,249
we have a big audience and a brand and all these different things,

821
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,769
but, yeah I will give you an example.

822
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,279
The number one thing our users are, more power users ask for,

823
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,409
which is the ability to watch multiple folders with your Dropbox.

824
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:19,009
And they're like why, you guys can see it on Votebox,

825
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,804
which is our - our sort of way of,

826
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,299
that we let our users vote on different features

827
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,459
that they want and make requests,

828
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,319
like why the hell haven't you guys let me - why don't you let me

829
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,129
watch multiple folders because I want to watch my documents,

830
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,094
I want to watch, map all these different things,

831
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:39,524
and the reason is, well the initial reason was like,

832
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:40,849
we built something simple because we didn't

833
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,614
have time to build something complicated.

834
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,479
So, it was more technically complicated, there was a lot of UI code,

835
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,659
there was all this different stuff,

836
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,154
that I would have had to go - I would have gone and had,

837
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,689
have built and we just didn't have time to build it

838
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,669
because we wanted to get something out the door.

839
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,399
But then we realized this is this great benefit to the simplicity of

840
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,769
the model where your Dropbox will look the same on your phone as it

841
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,439
does it on your computer and it's pretty easy to explain to people

842
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,649
that you have this magic folder and anything you save in here saves

843
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:11,649
everywhere and all these different benefits and conventionally,

844
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,909
playing with the other products is sort of like,

845
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:17,689
well welcome into this and please configure your folder

846
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:22,254
mapping and some people love that and that's great.

847
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,919
But most people are very,

848
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,129
very confused and if you're already skeptical enough that here's

849
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,849
this like new thing that you've never seen before and now they're

850
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:35,829
asking you about folder mappings and you know you don't spend your

851
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:38,609
time worrying about folders and files and things like that,

852
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,944
and you're going to be pretty turned off.

853
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,989
And we would find, when we did the usability test,

854
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,959
people couldn't even figure out how to install Dropbox to begin with,

855
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,884
like they would - we brought five people in literally

856
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,419
off the street and keep zero of five,

857
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,399
we kept a tally of all these things,

858
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,009
zero out of five people even discovered that there

859
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:59,779
is a tray icon or a little menu bar icon.

860
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:03,599
And if you don't know that then you're going to have a lot of trouble

861
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,004
getting back to your Dropbox folder and all kinds of other things,

862
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:07,340
you'll not going to have a good experience

863
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,084
and we were like wow zero percent.

864
00:45:10,957 --> 00:45:15,229
All right, because we get these emails,

865
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,259
we get these emails to feedback to our

866
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,659
feedback alias and one would be like,

867
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,884
oh my god, Dropbox is amazing, I love it;

868
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,719
and the next one would be like,

869
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:28,439
I don't understand how you MIT nerds have - I got a PhD in physics,

870
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,019
so I can't even understand this thing and there is

871
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,204
like this diatribe like one right after the other.

872
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:39,729
And we were like that's interesting and so we brought people in

873
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,809
off the street and then we started seeing all these things,

874
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,139
like okay the people are clicking,

875
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,589
the screenshots in the tour because they think it's their computer.

876
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:51,829
Well, you know you laugh but it's actually our problem right,

877
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,269
these are people that,

878
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:00,389
that would be paying us if they actually have a got experience.

879
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,319
And all kind of it, they would click on Internet Explorer

880
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,549
and it would obscure the download window,

881
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,839
so they couldn't figure out where the download actually went.

882
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,389
I mean it's just a list of dozens and dozens and

883
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,299
dozens of things and we just sanded them down,

884
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,949
we were just like, okay,

885
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:16,529
well we're going to get to thing number 71 today and that,

886
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,149
now if you actually install Dropbox you see this

887
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,569
big bouncing green arrow whenever you - hey,

888
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,599
this is the icon you have to click on to get to

889
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,969
your Dropbox and so kind of a long answer to,

890
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:34,139
it's amazing even just like 10% more friction might

891
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,414
cut your audience in half and it's exponential.

892
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:42,199
So we decided that it just was not worth the complexity to

893
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,659
build that and just wasn't worth the engineering tradeoff.

894
00:46:49,012 --> 00:46:52,234
I have a start-up and we use Dropbox every day and I don't know

895
00:46:52,334 --> 00:46:56,489
if it's a preference or not but why did you go with an interface

896
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:01,115
where if you remove the file but you're not removing a copy,

897
00:47:01,214 --> 00:47:05,294
that drives us crazy, is that a preference?

898
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:09,389
So the question is, why is it when you - when someone moves

899
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:14,049
something from a shared folder it moves and doesn't copy,

900
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,409
and you know unfortunately that's just that we only

901
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,519
have so much control over the underlying operating

902
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,419
system or the Finder or Explorer on Windows,

903
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,079
and that's just the way those things were designed and sort

904
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,644
of the extra magic that get sprinkled on that Dropbox does,

905
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,139
you know just isn't aware of it and so I mean there's

906
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,129
probably some kinds of hacks that we can do to like,

907
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,869
if you move something out of shared folder,

908
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,699
warn you about it or maybe do different schemes

909
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,669
to make things read only or things like that,

910
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,739
but yeah we're aware it's a problem and that

911
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,347
we should do something and make it better.

912
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,769
It's just a limitation of the - or it's just a constraint where we

913
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,489
don't actually make the underling operating system so we can only

914
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,119
have so much control over certain aspects of how it behaves.

915
00:48:05,418 --> 00:48:07,840
So you got really lucky finding a cofounder,

916
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,989
what advice would you have for trying to find a cofounder?

917
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,334
So what particular skills do you value looking back?

918
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,879
So the question is what do you look for in a cofounder?

919
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,819
And I think first and foremost there has

920
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,324
to be someone where you just really,

921
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:28,129
really respect their judgment, and just sort of respect,

922
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,049
just to have absolute faith and trust in them as a person.

923
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:37,699
It doesn't mean they have to be good at everything in fact it's actually

924
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,219
good if there's some complementarity and that there's some,

925
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,529
there'll be things that you're both interested in and in mine and

926
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,299
Arash' case we're both very passionate about the technology and

927
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,859
the product design and are very opinionated about those things,

928
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,604
and fortunately our tastes are pretty similar on that front.

929
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,519
But then there's stuff where it completely diverges,

930
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,239
I find the whole business side of the house absolutely fascinating,

931
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,549
I think a lot about the broader strategy of how do we end up,

932
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:04,589
we have the potential to be this really great company,

933
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,519
but how do we actually get there given all that

934
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,139
sort of minefield in the way and he does,

935
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:16,169
is not at all interested in any of that stuff.

936
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,229
He is happiest when he is like shaking an Android phone and

937
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,369
discovering that when you long hold it like this and then rotate

938
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:26,199
it and then shake it like you know there's some bug and he'll

939
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,924
be responding to questions on the forums on his death bed and

940
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:38,069
while I am capable of doing that like and I think it's important

941
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,349
for everybody to do some element of that,

942
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,719
I can focus on other areas but I know that he has like

943
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,519
got that under control and so I think yeah it's really,

944
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,394
you and your cofounder that's like you can't even really,

945
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,719
I mean you could have some kind of horrible situation where like

946
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,909
someone gets kicked out of these different things but they say,

947
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,749
you can't divorce your investors and in most cases you can't

948
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,739
really divorce your cofounder without pretty horrible things

949
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:10,249
happening and if more important than that is really,

950
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:13,019
you and your cofounder are kind of the seed crystal for

951
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,339
the early team that's going to assemble around you,

952
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,539
you know the first 10 people.

953
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,839
Those first 10 people are going to be the seed crystal for the next

954
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,539
100 and it keeps going out from there and in general talented people

955
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,169
are not going to like join people that are like less talented but there's

956
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,499
often a lot of pressure you can sort of let the hiring bar go where

957
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,199
you're like well we really need someone to solve this problem and it's

958
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,149
really hurting us that no one is like building this thing.

959
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,594
And so is it really,

960
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,509
the big a deal that this engineer kind of bombed that

961
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:46,529
question or like wasn't really that excited about Dropbox

962
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,134
or isn't really going to work that hard, you know you have to say no.

963
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,369
And so it's really just kind of finding

964
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:56,009
someone that matches you in that way.

965
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,549
How you do that is a much,

966
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:02,089
you know it's like how do you find a spouse, it's like this.

967
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,302
You'll spend more time with your cofounder than your spouse.

968
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:13,389
How do you react to somebody telling you that

969
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:17,984
it's just a feature and not a company?

970
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,369
Question is, how do you respond to someone telling you

971
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:25,044
that what you're making is a feature and not a product.

972
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,309
So Steve Jobs was giving us a little bit of hard

973
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,769
time saying that we were a feature and not a product

974
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,049
when we didn't wanted to sell our company.

975
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,834
And so I mean everybody has got an opinion.

976
00:51:41,327 --> 00:51:43,238
You mentioned that hiring great people is

977
00:51:43,337 --> 00:51:45,733
a very valuable aspect of your company,

978
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:48,285
but how do you spot great people?

979
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:54,869
So the question is hiring great people is an important aspect of

980
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:59,499
building a great company but how do you spot great people and it's

981
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:05,589
actually a really good question because some of these things are

982
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:10,559
more intuitive than other things because like for an engineer,

983
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:17,999
a good engineer can generally recognize another good engineer because

984
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,309
you can sort of analyze their code and have all these technical discussions

985
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:22,319
and you're both very kind of versed in the same thing,

986
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,129
but think about it, it's like okay,

987
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:30,129
well if you don't play guitar and you see

988
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,839
someone playing like a Beatles song,

989
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,769
you're like oh my god that's amazing this person is like playing

990
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:40,109
music and I can't even get my like fingers on the strings,

991
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,854
you are like wow it's amazing.

992
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:47,204
And this is the same way that someone who doesn't know anything

993
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,764
about computers is like I need a website for my mortgage firm

994
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:57,909
and I met this kid and he's typing all these symbols and he's

995
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,524
so like building this amazing website and wow.

996
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:04,349
But then after you meet more of these people,

997
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:09,039
then you meet Jimi Hendrix you know like okay,

998
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,729
but you can't tell or you can sort of tell but like,

999
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,209
the point is by just having that one data point you

1000
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,859
know there's nothing to extrapolate from that,

1001
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,869
other than that oh my god this person knows so much

1002
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:21,114
about this area that I don't know anything about.

1003
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,809
And this is really important as a really important

1004
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,419
subject because as a founder you might be a good engineer

1005
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,449
but you're not good at all that other stuff,

1006
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:31,129
and pretty much anybody who has made their background in some

1007
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,709
of their area like business development person or a finance person

1008
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,509
has got to know a whole lot more about that than you,

1009
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:40,189
and so one interesting thing we did is

1010
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:41,589
well we screwed it up a few times,

1011
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:46,769
we hired people that just didn't work out, a very painful experience.

1012
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,899
A lot of our, probably all of our early business people

1013
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,714
for the first couple of years we hired as consultants,

1014
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,569
which is kind of strange,

1015
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:57,749
I don't, it's hard to play it the other way so I don't know

1016
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,779
if it's a net good thing or a bad thing but it worked well,

1017
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,659
so that we sort of got - we learned a lot in the process of kind

1018
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:09,034
of getting a brain dump from this person and then we also,

1019
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:12,859
we talked to large numbers of - a lot of marketing people or

1020
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,749
a lot of finance people or a lot of business development people

1021
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,879
and over time you get more and more context that says okay,

1022
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,509
well what's really important in this field and then who is the

1023
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:26,299
best person I have ever met on this stuff and there's another area

1024
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,789
if you get sort of the best possible investors that you can,

1025
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,419
then they'll have really great networks of talented people in all

1026
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,549
these different fields and that's something where you can help

1027
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:39,589
lean on them to interview these candidates on your behalf but that

1028
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:43,839
is actually one of the harder things about doing this is,

1029
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,299
how do you judge people who you have no context for what they do.

1030
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,789
What do you as a CEO focus on on a daily basis?

1031
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:57,769
So the question is, what as a CEO do I focus on on a daily basis.

1032
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:02,859
Another hard question to answer but certainly what is the

1033
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,169
highest leverage use my time is one kind of framing,

1034
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:12,709
okay how can, I think it's sort of,

1035
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,129
there's a very long answer to that question,

1036
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:19,549
it's really how do we make sure we're doing the core things really,

1037
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,769
really well, like making sure we hiring really good people,

1038
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,739
making sure we're building a great product

1039
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,314
and making sure our users are happy.

1040
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,589
And then there's a whole bunch of other things that you have

1041
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:31,759
to worry more or less about over time and then there's a lot,

1042
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,329
then you build a team around you and then have to make sure

1043
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:38,489
that they are happy and effective and all kind of running

1044
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:42,169
in the same direction and then there's invariably fires that

1045
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:49,529
have to be put out and so it's actually - it's surprisingly

1046
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,629
complicated question to answer because many days,

1047
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,759
but especially when people make the transition from

1048
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,004
being an individual contributor to being a manager,

1049
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,699
so many days pass, you're like oh my

1050
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,709
god what did I even get done today.

1051
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,139
I am just like talking and I was just like

1052
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,974
responding to email and I am like. Do you focus on culture?

1053
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,789
It's the follow up question, do I focus on culture?

1054
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,799
Like absolutely, Arash my co-founder is

1055
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,694
even more opinionated about this stuff.

1056
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,424
One of my weaknesses was sort of double edge sword

1057
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,504
because I tend to be optimistic in general,

1058
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,229
and some are always like optimistic about people.

1059
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,479
So I am like, oh you know I'll give people to benefit

1060
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,569
the doubt and he's the other way around.

1061
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,039
So it's actually a good kind of counterbalance.

1062
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,639
So how you deal with cofounder share and why did

1063
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,524
Steve Jobs pick your company other than your competitors?

1064
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,664
Say the first part of the question.

1065
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:42,689
First question is how you deal with cofounder share. Cofounders.

1066
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:46,219
Like share percentage. Oh, share okay, dividing equity.

1067
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,319
The second is why did Steve Jobs pick your

1068
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,459
company rather than your competitors?

1069
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,039
So, I'll answer both questions quickly.

1070
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,334
So how do you divide up equity with your cofounder,

1071
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:01,949
and again a very nuanced subject,

1072
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:05,589
without, but people have written great things about that,

1073
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,409
and actually it's one of those things where if you look it up on Quora

1074
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:14,559
or you search for things on Google to get some very knowledgeable responses

1075
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,689
and so I don't really have anything beyond that to add.

1076
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,799
And then to be honest it's one of the basic things

1077
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,539
around make sure it's subject to vesting,

1078
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,869
meaning that they get it over time,

1079
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,509
so that if you have some disaster situation

1080
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,219
you don't have to deal with that.

1081
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:31,549
And the second question was why did Steve

1082
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,189
Jobs pick our company over competitors?

1083
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:39,549
I think any company that does something interesting on their way up,

1084
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,209
that gets all kinds of conversations like that,

1085
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,064
that happen and I think,

1086
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:48,329
the start of the conversation was a complement that we had

1087
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:53,314
a great product and which is high praise, I'll take it.

1088
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:58,999
Anyway I presume it's - I can't answer that on his behalf but presumably

1089
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,299
they've clearly understood that this is something important.

1090
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:08,024
All right. Thanks a bunch. We got a basis of an agreement.
