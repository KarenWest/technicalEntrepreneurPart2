1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,449
It is my since pleasure to introduce our special guest today.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,239
We have Mark Suster. I want to tell you a little bit about him.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,339
He earned his BA in Economics from University

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,549
of California of San Diego.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,049
He then went on and got his MBA from the University of Chicago.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,199
He then spent 10 years as a consultant at Accenture both in Europe,

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,339
in Japan and the US and then he started his first company.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,749
His first company was called BuildOnline which was

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,644
a large global content collaboration company.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,189
That's very alliterative. It was focused on engineering construction

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,754
sectors and then this company was sold.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,584
He then started another company called Koral

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,234
which he then sold to salesforce.com

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,308
and worked for Salesforce for about a year

15
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:46,550
and then left to join the VC firm,

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,014
GRP Partners which is headquartered in LA.

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,274
His talk today is called Lessons on Starting a Company.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,614
Without further ado, Mark.

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,479
I had originally titled my presentation Irreverent or Nonconformist

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,144
Lessons on Starting a Company because I think most of my ideas,

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,584
am I allowed to wonder or for video purposes do I need to stay put?

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,669
The other thing I thought about calling

23
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,319
it was Heresy in Silicon Valley.

24
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,949
My rationale is virtually everything that I had learned

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,244
about startups is heresy in Silicon Valley.

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,919
Just I'll talk you through one or two examples.

27
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,529
There seems to be an ethos in Silicon Valley that if you don't

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,449
build something worth $100 million, you're a failure.

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,239
I've had this conversation with so many young entrepreneurs

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,279
who get their first offer for $15,

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,039
$20, $30 million and I do the math for them on what that's worth.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,759
I say okay, let's do the exercise on what this is going to

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,819
look like if you do that $10 million round and what this is

34
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,789
going to look like if you try to scale something and create

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,299
something big and you might be successful and you may not.

36
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,269
I don't encourage people to sell early.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,889
I just encourage people not to be pressured by the standard

38
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,914
Silicon Valley mantra that you're a failure if you sell

39
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,289
as Michael Arrington called it a deep shit company.

40
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,459
I know that Dave McClure noted that by his standard,

41
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,484
his actually was a deep shit company.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,239
I assure you he'll be building a very nice

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,139
house wherever he chooses to live next. I learned this the hard way.

44
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,649
I started a company in 1999 based in London

45
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,659
called BuildOnline and at the time,

46
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,249
we became the poster child for startup companies

47
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,679
in Europe or at least one of the top 10 front cover

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,729
of the top venture capital magazine in Europe.

49
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,259
We were front cover of the business section of the Financial Times.

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,089
I got a dot-matrix in Wall Street Journal.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:16,349
I was invited to the private wine cellars of Bernard Arnault to drink

52
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,139
ancient champagne with the CEOs of 40 other companies called Sony,

53
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,649
Dell and other companies like that.

54
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,244
I was a really, really big deal until I wasn't.

55
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,459
That period lasted about six months.

56
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,409
In that period, we turned down an offer

57
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,699
to be acquired for $150 million.

58
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,319
We thought $150 million acquisition between three friends

59
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,834
was chump change because I had Goldman Sachs as an investor

60
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,419
and they were telling us we were going to IPO,

61
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,184
and the IPO would be within a year and it would be a billion dollars.

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,449
It sounds crazy now if you weren't part of those times.

63
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,609
For those of us with less hair or gray hair,

64
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,279
we know we lived through that.

65
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,549
But we looked at Chemdex which became Ventro that was

66
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,574
trading for $8 billion on $2 million in revenue,

67
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,819
so a billion dollars seemed achievable and we gave

68
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,119
out the spreadsheets to our employees joining,

69
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,559
telling them how much money 0.25%

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,189
was worth of the billion dollars. You do the math.

71
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,429
We were all proud of ourselves until the world changed.

72
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,964
My second company we built the product;

73
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,314
in total we worked on it for about a year and a half.

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,629
I had an offer to sell before I raised venture capital.

75
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,079
When I sold my first company, I owned 10% of the company.

76
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,219
When I sold my second company, I owned 73% of the company.

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,589
Those were different outcomes for me.

78
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,989
So I'm not saying there's a right answer for anybody.

79
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,039
For each of you, you have to choose whether you pursue your passions,

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,399
whether you really believe it's a big idea,

81
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,879
but I like people to understand the framework. I lived in Palo Alto.

82
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,929
My second company was based here and I was under

83
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,439
so much pressure not to sell but luckily,

84
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,499
second time around, I wasn't stupid.

85
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,979
So my background, I guess you already heard so I now live in Los

86
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,539
Angeles which means if you're in Silicon Valley it might as well

87
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,039
be Arkansas and nothing wrong with Arkansas but it's somehow disconnected

88
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,804
and can't possibly build tech firms but we have.

89
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,049
We built a small company called Overture that my firm invested in.

90
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,539
Back then, Google was saying that you

91
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,639
shouldn't have advertising and search.

92
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,369
Bill Gross who's from Los Angeles and Pasadena,

93
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,479
a graduate of Caltech said actually we have this concept called sponsored

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,139
search where we can have links and you can bid to the top and Google

95
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,384
sort of laughed at that until we were a very large company.

96
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,296
No question Google kicked their ass but they still sold for $1.6 billion.

97
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:01,460
They settled the $500 million lawsuit.

98
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,289
It was a $2.1 billion outcome.

99
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,749
AdWords, the concept of it was innovated in Los Angeles.

100
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,819
When you look at AdSense and I presume most of

101
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,509
you know the difference but in case you don't,

102
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,914
AdWords being on the O&O traffic,

103
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,419
owned and operated traffic of Google;

104
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,039
AdSense being those that they share with their

105
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,999
parties was innovated in Los Angeles.

106
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,179
Another graduate of Caltech,

107
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,299
Gil Elbaz who created a company called the Applied Semantics,

108
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,209
he had a cofounder, I don't remember

109
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,254
his cofounder's name, in Los Angeles.

110
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,759
So I just want to point out that there are tech people there.

111
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,389
We do have an industry. We have had many exits.

112
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,414
It is not and never will be Silicon Valley,

113
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,664
but that's not what I'm here to talk about today.

114
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,094
I'm here to talk about getting started,

115
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,179
raising venture capital and some lessons that I learned.

116
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,329
I'll start at the kind of most superficial level which

117
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,689
is having an idea and it sort of sounds obvious but

118
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,029
this is actually where most people get stuck.

119
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,139
If I look at the funnel of potential entrepreneurs,

120
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,669
I think this idea phase people get crippled by it and

121
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,239
it's the reason most people don't start businesses.

122
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,399
I like to tell people,

123
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,109
you actually don't have to be a genius to start a business.

124
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,279
You have to kind of be a genius if you

125
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,829
want to create Google, but 99.9%

126
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,809
of successful startups are not Google and yet still lead to

127
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,239
very rewarding careers where you can work for yourself,

128
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,569
choose your own destiny, have your own experiences and make a lot

129
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,209
of money doing it but you have a problem.

130
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,519
That problem is you have to get started.

131
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,079
So how did I get started?

132
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,929
I was working at what was called Andersen Consulting.

133
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,099
It's not called Accenture.

134
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,789
I started as a software developer and we did what probably

135
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,809
a lot of you guys do or you will do in the next five years,

136
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,949
is we sat around with a bunch of buddies after work at

137
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,914
a coffee shop and we talked about starting a company.

138
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,009
We seemed to do this for about nine freaking

139
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,184
months and nobody would do anything about it.

140
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,459
Many years later and this is always how it goes,

141
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,649
everyone said I had the idea to do something

142
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,929
like Skype and if I would have only done it.

143
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,074
I'm sure you've heard people say that. I had the idea for eBay.

144
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,549
I had it long before eBay started.

145
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,649
But really, people don't do anything about it,

146
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,964
so I like to tell people if you have conviction

147
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,808
in life to be an entrepreneur and I want to tell

148
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:45,319
you and it's part of my presentation later,

149
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,419
being an entrepreneur is not sexy.

150
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,069
It is pretty awful.

151
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,624
It is stress, long hours, huge responsibility,

152
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,909
huge pressure, competitive. It is not for everybody.

153
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,559
It's a rare unique individual who chooses to do this

154
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,874
really crazy thing called being an entrepreneur.

155
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,929
But if in your gut you think that's you or you want it to be you,

156
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,219
this is the single biggest gate in gating items

157
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,469
that keeps most people from being entrepreneurs,

158
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,999
starting, as dumb as it sounds.

159
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,259
The next mistake I made,

160
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,324
and by the way I didn't start by saying this,

161
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,189
I made every mistake at my first startup, every single one.

162
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,179
You name it. If you read it on a blogger and a textbook, I made it.

163
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,049
I raised too much capital. I hired too many people.

164
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,689
I started talking in the press before my product was any good.

165
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,669
I charged too much for my products. I staffed up quickly.

166
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,519
I built four products in five countries.

167
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:57,179
The one thing I had was the conviction to see it through.

168
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,099
I'm going to talk about this later, this BS idea of fail fast.

169
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,749
I said I made a commitment. I took people's money.

170
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,069
I got people to quit their jobs. I told customers to use our product

171
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,429
and I'm going to see this through.

172
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,679
I'm going to be better than just having

173
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,374
been a bunch of PR and marketing.

174
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,489
The one mistake I made because I did see it through,

175
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,149
the one mistake I made was I chose a

176
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,569
topic that I wasn't passionate about.

177
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,374
I'm passionate about technology. I'm passionate about film.

178
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,809
I've spent a lot of time in the corporate world on corporate initiatives

179
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,789
before I ever got started as an entrepreneur but the way that I got

180
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,919
started was a friend of mine from business school had an idea.

181
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,289
His idea was we could make engineering and construction

182
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,199
firms imminently more effective and efficient.

183
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,329
The way we would do that is we would take an

184
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,529
industry that on average spend about 0.7%

185
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:06,101
of revenue on R&D and IT and IT initiatives compared to

186
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:09,834
between 1.5 to 2.4% for most companies.

187
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,839
And because they were so far behind in IT,

188
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,149
there was such a gap that we could

189
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,619
really revolutionize this industry.

190
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,859
Construction, engineering, transportation, these big projects

191
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,569
represent between 11 to 13% of GDP;

192
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,599
big market, ripe for innovation,

193
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,179
actually could've done something huge. I still believe it.

194
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,239
I just hated it. I hated going to all these stupid meetings

195
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,549
with all the contractors and engineers.

196
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,539
We're talking about stuff that I'm sure was really fascinating.

197
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,409
I'm sure people have no interest in the

198
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,139
tech stuff that I'm interested in,

199
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,649
like I live in LA where people like to talk about scripts and Hollywood

200
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,339
and they kind of get bored if I'm talking about Jason,

201
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,249
but it's what I'm passionate about.

202
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,719
Choose something that you are. You need to do a bit of research.

203
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:15,179
Silicon Valley, you're not going to want to hear this, is lazy.

204
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,559
I don't mean lazy as in don't do your hard

205
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,669
work or work long hours or productive.

206
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,739
I certainly wouldn't accuse Silicon Valley

207
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,889
of not being smart and innovative.

208
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,764
It is a model or us all to learn from, myself included.

209
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,539
But for whatever reason,

210
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,789
this town has come up with the idea that doing

211
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,659
research about a market is a bad thing,

212
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,629
as though somehow I just have to launch products and learn.

213
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,199
But the most basic of research,

214
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,059
I'm not talking about writing an 80-page Word document.

215
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,014
I'm talking about doing a spreadsheet, some basic economics,

216
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,739
like if you're going to launch something,

217
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,829
asking yourself the question, what do I imagine someday?

218
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,349
Do I imagine someone's going to pay me for this product

219
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,429
or am I going to monetize for third party?

220
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,049
If they're going to pay me for it, what else are they paying for?

221
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,099
Basic microeconomics, what am I replacing?

222
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,069
If it's going to be third party revenues,

223
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,149
is that going to be ad supported, is that going to be selling data?

224
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,424
If it's ad supported,

225
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,249
what are industry CPMs these days for a vertical offering,

226
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,409
for a horizontal offering, for an email newsletter?

227
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,699
If I'm in the email newsletter business, who else is in there?

228
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,134
What are the click-through rates?

229
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,569
What have the people who have come before done? What worked?

230
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,589
What didn't work? When people come to see me and they don't know the

231
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,509
history of the industry that they're choosing,

232
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:44,469
I pass always because if you're not going to do that research,

233
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,929
it tells me that you're probably not the kind of person

234
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,419
in my opinion who's going to do big things.

235
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,189
And yes, people win the lottery.

236
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,939
Everyone likes to use that as an example of why

237
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,644
I can just launch Twitter and see what happens,

238
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,474
but the exception does not prove the rule.

239
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,559
I'm just talking about the most basic research.

240
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,589
You do yourself all a favor and get a prototype built.

241
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,829
When I started BuildOnline,

242
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,379
it took about $2 million to get the company off the ground.

243
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,529
Why? I had to buy Sun serves; I had to buy Solaris;

244
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,614
I had to get an Oracle license;

245
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,799
I had to have expensive web hosting, bandwidth was really expensive.

246
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,524
It's not longer the case.

247
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,140
It costs $15,000 to $20,000, maybe even $5,000 to $10,000

248
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,060
to get initial prototypes built.

249
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,919
I don't know. Are there engineers in the room or software developers?

250
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,609
Can you raise your hand if you develop software?

251
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,909
So for all you people,

252
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,674
you have a huge advantage which is you can do most of this yourself.

253
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,334
For anyone who can't do it themselves,

254
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,479
I still encourage you even if it's throwaway

255
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,044
software to get that first veneer built. Why?

256
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,674
All this stuff Steve Blank talks about,

257
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,354
going and testing it with customers.

258
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,119
They can't visualize their way into deciding

259
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,944
if you've got an interesting offering.

260
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,849
It is far better to sit with HTML mockups and walk people

261
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,819
through what you do and get feedback on that and say,

262
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,269
well, what are you using today to do this and how

263
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,184
would you imagine working through this workflow?

264
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,624
How much would you pay for an offering like this?

265
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,479
And being able to show people.

266
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,649
When you're raising money being able to show venture capitalists

267
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,559
what you have is almost a requirement these days.

268
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,769
I still see a lot of people who are pitching ideas of what they

269
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,029
want to build and I just don't think in 2010 that's acceptable.

270
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,999
Most of that is fairly straightforward.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,769
I want to go into the heresy bit a little bit.

272
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,589
So this bit's not heresy: assemble a diverse team.

273
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,769
I can't remember who told me. I do remember who told me.

274
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,059
Seth Sternberg.

275
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,949
I was talking with Seth of Meebo maybe about a month ago and he said,

276
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,744
you know what, tall people hang out with tall people.

277
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:18,439
Obviously, I have no experience from which to judge that

278
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,499
but he said short people hang out with short people.

279
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,974
I guess as an average person, I hang out with average people.

280
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,089
We tend to hang out with people who are kind of like us.

281
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,079
He was saying his number one advice and I agree with it,

282
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,409
is get outside your box,

283
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,189
figure out the people you're going to assemble around yourself

284
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,519
that are different from you that you can learn from,

285
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,719
they're going to stretch you.

286
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,034
If you are naturally an introvert,

287
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,799
there ought to be someone on your team who's an extrovert who's going

288
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,569
to spend a little bit more time out with customers and business development

289
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,129
and pushing things that maybe is your comfort zone.

290
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,099
You still got to go do it.

291
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,889
You're going to learn from them but having people that you

292
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,849
push outside your comfort zone for me is really important.

293
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,529
So thinking in terms of diversity.

294
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:17,039
Heresy. The biggest illusion that comes to you as an individual

295
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,374
comes before you ever see an evil venture capitalist.

296
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,559
You're going to argue to me that you should

297
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,524
only take 22% dilution instead of 24%.

298
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,629
We're going to fight over 0.75%.

299
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,139
You're going to fight with me about whether we should have a 15%

300
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,494
option pull versus 17% option pull versus 13% option pull,

301
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,789
but you're willing to see two-thirds of the value of your company

302
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,469
walk out the door before you've ever done a day's work.

303
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,979
I just don't get that.

304
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,199
I don't get it.

305
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,159
If you're trying to create something and create value for

306
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,124
yourself and you have the confidence of your conviction,

307
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,669
my recommendation is to start on your own.

308
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,389
That's the biggest heresy that I'll ever say.

309
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,879
Now, there are people for which are missing

310
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,304
certain skill sets to build a company.

311
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,419
That's okay. I just have a sequencing for them.

312
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,514
Because that you are paid such a premium to take the first leap,

313
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,954
my Andersen Consulting experience,

314
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,129
sitting around with a bunch of guys who just kept saying,

315
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,159
we should do this and we should do that,

316
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,849
and I freaking did it and then they came to work for me for 1%.

317
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:46,049
They come to work for me for 1% four months after I jumped.

318
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,749
Now, don't misunderstand me.

319
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,129
I believe in having partners.

320
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,484
I believe in inviting people in and giving them large stakes.

321
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,839
That stake may even be 20%,

322
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:12,653
25%, 30%, 35% but there's kind of a mythology in Silicon Valley

323
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:19,169
which is that the cofounder's model is the only model

324
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,444
and we know it because we have Larry and Sergey and we have

325
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,749
Steve Chen and Chad Hurley and David and Jerry.

326
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,464
Each of these images that I pulled up,

327
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,499
I never had to type the last name.

328
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,239
I literally just typed Jerry and David and it came up,

329
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,959
and I typed Steve and Chad and it came up.

330
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,909
That's how baked into our system it is.

331
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,469
Just because this model has worked does not mean the model works.

332
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,534
I'm here to tell you what happens on the inside

333
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,619
because we know most companies fail.

334
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,929
I spent so much time as a marriage counselor

335
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,539
with startups who don't get along,

336
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,569
and it happens something like this.

337
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,429
Life event, someone wants to throw himself at this company,

338
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,449
the other person doesn't.

339
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,409
Someone gets married and they have a girlfriend or boyfriend

340
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,559
and they get pulled to other opportunities.

341
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,179
Some people perform better, some don't. We had cofounders;

342
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,139
we didn't decide who was CEO.

343
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,839
Now we got a company and people are interested in funding us.

344
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,339
Which one of us is going to be CEO?

345
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,839
These kinds of issues are garden variety happen all the time.

346
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,069
We just don't talk about them because we know

347
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,619
this Silicon Valley myth that it always works.

348
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,869
So for me, it's a sequencing thing.

349
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,369
I say to people even if you started and you decided to

350
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,379
give 45% to somebody else to do it but ultimately,

351
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,589
I prefer a stable environment where I have a passionate founder,

352
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,329
passionate leader, willing to share equity,

353
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,509
willing to bring people in decision-making but divorce clauses.

354
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,239
I saw a company recently,

355
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:05,449
very interesting company that had two cofounders and one

356
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,014
of them walked and they didn't have founder vesting,

357
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,829
so the guy who walked has a free ride on 50%

358
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,364
equity while the other mug sweats his,

359
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,639
I won't say it, and tries to create something

360
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,399
big for this guy who's not even working.

361
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,569
If you go for the cofounder model which I'm not telling

362
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,599
you don't do it because I know everybody likes to,

363
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,339
make sure you have founder vesting.

364
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,209
You protect yourself as an individual and

365
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,909
you protect your partner by the way,

366
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,624
too, because it might be you who decides not to work.

367
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,959
There has to be a clause that says what

368
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,369
happens if we fall out of love.

369
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,104
What happens if one person's passionate and the other person isn't?

370
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,389
I will tell you also it becomes a problem in fundraising.

371
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,749
We look at a company.

372
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,504
We see four founders, two of them are gone,

373
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,039
two of them only have 12% equity each

374
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,799
because they raised angel money.

375
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,919
They had four founders,

376
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,854
they started at 25, they got diluted down to 12.

377
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,109
As a venture capitalist, I'm just thinking okay,

378
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:16,019
let me tell you what happens. I put in money, your 12% becomes 8%.

379
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,729
We do another round, your 8% becomes 5% and then I got to top you out

380
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,569
with stock options and we play this BS game.

381
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,854
So often when I see situations like that

382
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,114
and I think some VCs feel like this,

383
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,668
I just prefer not to get involved.

384
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,129
Make sure that tech is part of your DNA.

385
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,469
I'm probably in the wrong place to say this message

386
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,939
because I think it's pretty well understood here,

387
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,049
but particularly outside of Silicon Valley you see a lot

388
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,339
of people who have third parties build their software.

389
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,259
I'm okay if a third party builds your prototype just

390
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,609
to get it up and running but you have got to.

391
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,909
If you want to be an internet business or a tech business,

392
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:02,219
you got to have a foundation, the DNA has got to be technical.

393
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,399
I guess Jason Neus in LA can attest to this how many people in LA

394
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,089
come to me and it's three business guys who know Ashton Kutcher.

395
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:17,433
You don't know Ashton, do you?

396
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:22,899
Did I say that to you when you came in? Okay, sorry.

397
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,149
But I normally tell people it's for your own good,

398
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,099
go find a tech person because this idea that I can

399
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,599
have a third party build it for cheap somewhere

400
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,389
else and we're the business guys, we get it.

401
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,624
It just never works. It never scales. It never becomes interesting.

402
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,504
People often don't think about when businesses are bought,

403
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,019
if they're bought on profits,

404
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,509
okay, they're buying you for a different reason but

405
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,979
if they're really buying you in the $15 to $50 million

406
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,239
range which I will repeat, is a lot of money.

407
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,479
If they buy you in that range, they're often buying what you have,

408
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,814
the technology, the market positioning but they want you,

409
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:06,579
they want your team. They don't want to buy something that has eight

410
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,739
guys remote for a third party building software.

411
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,049
Raising capital, I always tell people that you obviously need

412
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,859
to raise capital but be careful about raising too much.

413
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,819
You start by raising a small amount enough to really get going.

414
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,789
Why do I say this?

415
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,799
There are people who build an interesting idea. It gets competitive.

416
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,659
They have talents. They have a PhD from Stanford and they

417
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,319
can raise $5 million from the get-go.

418
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,269
Let's say they raise it at an $8 million and

419
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,439
pre and they diluted more than they should.

420
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,739
In a business, there are two problems with raising too

421
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,979
much capital too quickly and I made both of them,

422
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,509
I made both mistakes.

423
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,579
Number one is the expectations of you are that you're

424
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,819
going to do something big and you got to go fast,

425
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,849
and I say it's like adding rocket fuel before

426
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,459
you really know where the rocket is pointing.

427
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,394
It's very destructive to a company.

428
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,469
You will feel pressured to spend it and

429
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,214
you'll feel pressured to go fast.

430
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,984
The second thing is you take all your options off the table.

431
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,809
Whatever you're building isn't working,

432
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,749
wouldn't you like to have some option to safely park something,

433
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,119
meaning a sale that's not huge but at

434
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,929
least preserves what you've built, preserves the customers,

435
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,099
preserves some of the jobs from the people you took out of their other

436
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,689
companies and maybe creates a little bit of wealth for yourself?

437
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,854
You give up that option if you raise too much too quickly.

438
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,649
So I want to tell you an interesting story.

439
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,949
Two days ago, I was on this god-awful website,

440
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,689
it's called Formspring. Do you guys use it? Really?

441
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,459
I got suckered in the way probably some other

442
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,029
people as someone posed a question about me.

443
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,969
Mark Suster says that a lean startup shouldn't raise that much money

444
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,789
and then eventually if it hits product market fit should become fat.

445
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,449
I said that. It's true.

446
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,129
Eric Reese, one of the most beloved young speakers,

447
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,269
lecturers in Silicon Valley,

448
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:28,329
someone who's reading I read and enjoy wrote

449
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,979
a response which I found curious.

450
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:37,289
He said, Mark misunderstood the meaning of the term lean startup.

451
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,899
Luckily, there's an internet so I pulled up the definition of lean.

452
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,969
Without much flesh or fat,

453
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,079
not plump, of edible meat containing little or no fat,

454
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,729
lacking in richness, full, spare, economical.

455
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,679
And yet he says the lean startup is about moving fast.

456
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,234
The fast startup is about moving fast.

457
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,099
The rapid startup is about moving fast.

458
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,189
The quick startup, not the lean startup.

459
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,779
Okay, it's not my movement,

460
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:13,379
I'll let you have your movement but I believe in lean startup.

461
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,434
Then something changes.

462
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,774
You raised a little bit of money, you work on your product.

463
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,469
You don't do what I did which is spend too much money,

464
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,299
hire a bunch of developers before you figured it all out.

465
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,479
What I often tell people is you should be flipping hamburgers

466
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,579
if you're going to run a hamburger chain.

467
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,519
That means that you're doing customer support,

468
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,519
you're answering phone calls, you're going on sales calls,

469
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,199
you're involved in product management, you do user testing.

470
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,909
Raising too much capital too quickly before there's

471
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,159
a product market fit makes this very hard to do.

472
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,069
So I sort of agree with what Ben Horowitz

473
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,129
said which is the fat startup, and it's okay later in life,

474
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:01,469
obviously I would think this, to get a bit fat.

475
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:08,344
What I mean is if you become Foursquare, you got two choices.

476
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,249
You can sell and that $100 million outcome for most people that

477
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,319
Yahoo reportedly had offered would have been quite the nice,

478
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,209
but the founders that already had one exit and I think they

479
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,924
really wanted to change the world and I think that's great.

480
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,959
But if you're going to change the world and you wake up the

481
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,694
sleeping lions of Silicon Valley to this opportunity,

482
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,569
you better get fat pretty quickly because you've got

483
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,129
yelp in town here and those guys are smart and move

484
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,719
fast and you obviously have Facebook in town.

485
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,549
Those guys are very smart and move very fast.

486
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,219
So if you're going to compete with people in

487
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,219
what people call winner take most markets, you need to be fat.

488
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,459
So we see Groupon and LivingSocial who have

489
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,949
raised money and are big and are growing.

490
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,189
I don't think number 5,

491
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,499
6, 7, 8 are going to be that relevant in the long run.

492
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,329
So there are times where fat is okay.

493
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,239
The other Silicon Valley thing that I find really curious

494
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,739
is this idea of fail fast and people told me I misunderstood

495
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,019
fail fast so I looked it up in the dictionary.

496
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,359
To fall short of success in something you expected,

497
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,719
to receive less than passing grade or mark,

498
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:25,509
to be or become deficient or lacking, to dwindle away, pass or die.

499
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,469
And yet, the fail fast mantra somehow in

500
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,259
Silicon Valley means launch product,

501
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,554
see what people think about it, pivot, change your product.

502
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,089
How is that failing fast?

503
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,869
Okay, I know everyone likes to attack me when I say

504
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,529
that because I'm slaying a dragon or sacred cows.

505
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,389
Is that what they call them? Sacred cow.

506
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,829
I think the one thing I could teach Silicon Valley is,

507
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,939
first of all, your name should be your URL.

508
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,789
If your name is wildfire,

509
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:03,259
your URL should not be wildfire-interactive.com.

510
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,039
Call yourself wildfire-interactive.

511
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,779
Call yourself anything but this confusion in the

512
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,689
internet era doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

513
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,669
Make sure your name doesn't box you into a corner.

514
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,589
I said to Bill Gross, the guy who created Overture and jest when

515
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,824
he created a company called TweetUp,

516
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,279
I publicly said I predict within one year this company

517
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,809
will company will not be called TweetUp.

518
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:37,649
Why would you build something that has one channel, Twitter?

519
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,739
Why would you build something that has one channel, salesforce.com,

520
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,939
Apple iPhone, Facebook?

521
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,609
If you're building a product, you need multichannel.

522
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,599
It's okay to start somewhere but if you

523
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,844
don't start by thinking multichannel, I think you'll be in trouble.

524
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,759
Salesforce would have you believe,

525
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,849
and I know a thing or two about Salesforce that you

526
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:05,759
ought to build on their platform called force.com.

527
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,699
You ought to do that if you haven't thought

528
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,279
through how to build a company,

529
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,229
but if you've thought I want to have a multichannel strategy and

530
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,949
I don't want to be beholden to one individual component of that channel

531
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:24,279
and one player then I don't suggest it's a very good idea.

532
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,649
So TweetUp is now called PostUp. I was right.

533
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,079
I should have put money on it.

534
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,269
The second prediction I made not too long ago that

535
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,809
was that BlackBerry or the owner of BlackBerry,

536
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,089
RIM, would be sold within a year so we'll start the clock on that

537
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,829
one and see if I'm right on that but that's a total aside.

538
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,079
The thing I could teach Silicon Valley is the last one,

539
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,364
be careful about words that mean something else because

540
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,289
I'm sort of flippant about it but I see so many young

541
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:58,299
entrepreneurs these days who tell me, well, I raised $200,000.

542
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,069
I launched and learned and I created a product.

543
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,279
I didn't do any research.

544
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,019
They probably don't say that but they didn't.

545
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,589
The market didn't come so I'm shutting it

546
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,929
down and I'm moving on to my next one. I say wow, why?

547
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,869
Oh, well, I'm failing fast. Okay.

548
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,599
How about those customers who signed up for your service and

549
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,069
trusted you to at least give it your best college effort?

550
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,819
How about those employees who joined you even if it was $45,000

551
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,869
a year customer support person because they believed in your

552
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,784
vision and that you were going to stick this through?

553
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,199
How about the person who gave you $200,000?

554
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,419
It's okay if it was an evil venture capitalist because $200,000

555
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,439
is not that much money but how about everybody else?

556
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,959
I don't believe in stupidly staying with your business.

557
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,274
I stupidly stayed for six years.

558
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,449
I knew that I wasn't going to make that much money.

559
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,879
I knew that the structure of what I had built had inherent problems.

560
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,029
I knew that I wasn't passionate about it.

561
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,419
I probably after about four years should have

562
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,329
recruited someone more passionate than I was,

563
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,369
but I felt this deep sense of commitment.

564
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,119
I just hate that there's a whole generation

565
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,554
of people and I'm not saying everybody,

566
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,729
but there's certainly enough of them that don't feel

567
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,579
that same sense of commitment to see something through

568
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,249
when you say that you were going to do it.

569
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,469
So that's why I have an issue with fail fast.

570
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,349
And if you're going to call something lean startup,

571
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:30,374
I mean, I won't say it, I'm on tape.

572
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,899
Another conventional wisdom,

573
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,619
I say if you can avoid the three Fs, you should.

574
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,089
For anyone who doesn't know what the three Fs are,

575
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,714
it's friends, family and fools.

576
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,374
It's the mythology of where you start.

577
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,964
Okay, if your uncle, your father is Steve Jobs,

578
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,649
your cousin is Mark Zuckerberg,

579
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,579
you can start with friends and family.

580
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,699
But for everybody else if they're doctors

581
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,339
and dentists and architects,

582
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,059
I mean if you can't raise money somewhere else,

583
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,759
then I get it but you ought to try.

584
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,109
Why? Because your business is likely going to fail.

585
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:15,469
Hopefully not fast but fail.

586
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,919
It just creates this tension and awkwardness and doctors,

587
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,689
dentists, lawyers, pharmacy people,

588
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,219
teachers, whatever, they're not used to this

589
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,009
idea that I write a check and it's wasted.

590
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,519
I tell my wife literally every time I write

591
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,619
an angel check which I prefer not to,

592
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,209
and I've been suckered into nine times in the last 18 months,

593
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:43,329
I say take that off our asset register. It is gone. It's done.

594
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,359
Most angel money is wasted and there's this new myth and

595
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,674
everybody wants to be superman or at least super angels,

596
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:57,869
and I think Manu who's here in the room and I said it publicly

597
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,799
is one of the smartest one who's out there so if you need,

598
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,729
he's got lots of it.

599
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,379
But a very clear sense of purpose and a very clear

600
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,569
prioritization of what he wants to invest in.

601
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,259
I'm probably putting words in your mouth

602
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,799
so I hope I don't misrepresent this,

603
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,944
but companies that are lean, companies that are technical,

604
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,764
companies in the Silicon Valley,

605
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,829
companies that are going to be capital efficient

606
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,019
and not pile on with a ton of cash.

607
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,239
There's a series of other things but it basically boils down

608
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,629
to be an angel investor and make money is hard and if you're

609
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,629
just going to invest across the patch in a bunch of stuff,

610
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:40,449
it sounds cool because there's some BS thing called social proof.

611
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,629
Most people who do that lose money but you

612
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,649
don't read about that in TechCrunch.

613
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,369
So I'd say avoid friends and family.

614
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:53,239
What I think you ought to start with is start with

615
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,959
technical people who have had a lot of exit,

616
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,289
made a bit of money and have something

617
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,409
to add because more than anything, they will understand you,

618
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,704
your business, what you're going to go through.

619
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,704
They will be able to coach you and mentor you.

620
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,499
And if it does fail and it probably will or at least

621
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,749
it won't make them the money they expected because

622
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,989
you'll raise more money that'll dilute them,

623
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,809
at least it was someone who went in realistic

624
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:24,859
and doesn't make Thanksgiving awkward. Angels versus VC.

625
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,169
So angels are on the right.

626
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:37,149
I tell people ironically but truthfully start with angels.

627
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,299
Angels are okay if you raised 250k,

628
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,759
500k and you sell for $8 million and that's a good outcome

629
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,929
for most people and angels will be fine with that.

630
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,299
Or if you get an offer immediately for $15 million

631
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,694
within a year and a half and you say,

632
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,669
okay, I'll have door number two because

633
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,834
that allows me to buy a house,

634
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,174
kids' college education even though I don't have kids yet,

635
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,364
retirement money, I'll take door number two.

636
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,069
Angels will be fine with that.

637
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,219
Raise VC money when you really think you want to go on a rocket ship.

638
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,999
Now, there are some people, and I think it's okay,

639
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,056
I don't want to imply that I think this is bad, who know.

640
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:28,109
Larry and Sergey didn't. They tried to sell for a million dollars.

641
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,449
But there are some people who say I want

642
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,474
to do something, and that's okay.

643
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,159
Then for me, it doesn't come down to angels versus VCs.

644
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,289
It comes down to people.

645
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,549
McKenzie is probably the best strategy consulting company out there

646
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,659
and it's still filled with a lot of people who know nothing.

647
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,849
It's filled with a lot of people who know something.

648
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:54,609
It depends who you get. Wilson Sonsini is probably the best law firm

649
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,824
in town or at least in the top three or four;

650
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:02,019
it's filled with some great lawyers and some bad ones.

651
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,179
Really, what I would say to people,

652
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,724
number one, you need to fill a human connection.

653
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,804
I used to say this. I need to think of a better way to say this.

654
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,824
Assume I said this in a better way.

655
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:22,969
I tell people raising venture capital is worse than marriage.

656
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,099
The reason I say that,

657
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,159
I'm very happily married and I've only been married to one

658
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,939
woman in my whole life and I hope that always is the case.

659
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,684
But in marriage, if things don't work

660
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,459
in this country you can get divorced.

661
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,169
You can't get divorced from your venture capitalist.

662
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,709
People want to come to me. They've never met me before.

663
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,409
They want to come in and in two weeks or a week,

664
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,809
they want to decide whether or not to take money from me.

665
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,854
I'm like, why would you do that?

666
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,999
You don't know me and you don't know what it's like to work with me.

667
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,799
I mean, don't you want to get to know me if you're

668
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,259
going to marry me because I could bury you?

669
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,329
I could make your life miserable as a VC.

670
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,739
I've done six investments in the three years I've been a VC.

671
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,249
I've done nine angel deals.

672
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,529
I think those 15 people would say that there are

673
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,089
some positive and there are some negative.

674
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,264
I hope they would say the positive outweighs the negative,

675
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,839
but all that's discoverable.

676
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,909
Spend time getting to know these people and don't rush into it.

677
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:28,229
I always say to you every VC, and I'm off topic here a little bit,

678
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:33,789
is going to give you the list of the five portfolio companies

679
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,949
you should call and of course you have to call them,

680
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,419
but make sure you call the other five that they didn't give you.

681
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,389
I mean I'm sure they've taught you here about selective bias.

682
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:50,299
If they give you five CEOs and they don't all say this is the best firm

683
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,979
I've ever worked with then definitely don't work with that firm.

684
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,459
It's not that hard to research who else they worked with and that's

685
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,719
where you ought to put your effort in the due diligence.

686
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,359
I think it's a false dichotomy.

687
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,129
If you want to raise small amounts of money

688
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,019
and preserve options, focus on angels.

689
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,609
If you really want to build something big,

690
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,079
there are pros and cons of angels and VCs.

691
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,734
Angels in a bad market tap out really quickly

692
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,769
and are not able to follow on as easily.

693
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,699
VCs who put in money and you don't prove what you

694
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,304
were supposed to prove for your first 500k,

695
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,179
writing the next 500k is not that painful.

696
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,549
It's different with angels.

697
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,999
Sometimes VCs get involved very early and then they don't

698
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,689
spend time with you and if they decide not to fund you,

699
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,689
there's this thing called signaling that

700
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,839
we need to worry about, and it's true.

701
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,824
If they don't support you, life becomes harder to raise capital.

702
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,819
There are pros and cons of both these. It's not that easy.

703
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,199
So how do you get access to us?

704
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,869
I'm going to talk for a maximum five minutes,

705
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,189
maybe even three because I want to save time to answer questions.

706
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,069
The best way to get access is other entrepreneurs.

707
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,529
It's pretty easy in a social networking world to figure

708
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,654
out how to get access to me and if you can't,

709
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,699
that probably is a defining way of figuring out

710
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,239
whether or not you're a real entrepreneur.

711
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,879
It's pretty easy in this era. So how do you get our money?

712
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,374
The first thing you need is an anchor investor.

713
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:26,319
Most investors, no secret, no prices for guessing this,

714
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,889
are not willing to take a risk and put their

715
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,824
name on a deal and say I want to do this.

716
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,889
At least early stage investors, they're looking for other people so

717
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,179
you need to get an anchor investor.

718
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,809
There are two strategies for doing this.

719
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,439
Number one, invite them to be an adviser,

720
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,479
get to know them, work with them as an adviser.

721
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,659
If they get excited about you,

722
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,469
sometimes they'll get our their checkbook.

723
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,239
Number two, people don't like to talk about this but

724
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,629
I always say no matter how rich you are, you want a deal.

725
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,988
So if you could say to someone I'm planning to raise at 2.5 pre,

726
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:04,009
I'd like to invite you in at 1 pre to work with me first.

727
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,709
Getting that first person on board really matters,

728
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,249
and everybody else sort of follows.

729
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,839
The industry, unfortunately,

730
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,079
the way it works is there's a lot of sheep.

731
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,004
So critical success factors.

732
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,969
If anyone comes and tells me about freaking badges or check-ins,

733
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,234
I'm done, like meeting over.

734
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:31,239
So many people are skating where the puck is and they read

735
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,834
about something on TechCrunch and think this is a fun idea.

736
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,909
I want to know where the puck is going.

737
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,639
If your check-ins for TV,

738
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,619
I'm sorry, like you've got to have a second act

739
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,749
like check-ins for TV for me is not a big idea.

740
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,639
Ship your product.

741
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,779
The defining moment for most startup is they don't ship product

742
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,919
and I think that's a big failure in this world of MBP.

743
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,859
Get your product out the door, show you can ship, refine it.

744
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,319
You don't have to open it up to the

745
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,384
world but show you can ship product.

746
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,114
Test monetization early,

747
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,344
figure out what people are willing to pay for and not pay for.

748
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,979
You don't need to raise $50 million to become Ning and

749
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,139
then figure out you should not have a free offering.

750
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,534
Test monetization early.

751
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,914
I like to tell people that a sausage factory is never pretty.

752
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,459
Everyone thinks that being inside a startup is

753
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,789
great and then the people get in there like,

754
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,479
man, this is hard, like everyone is fighting and people

755
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,999
don't get along and we can't figure out direction.

756
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,739
I'm like hello, like go see Google,

757
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,759
Twitter or Facebook, Zynga or whatever.

758
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,019
I mean it's a sausage factory on the inside and you have

759
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,582
to enjoy that chaos and the end result of sausage

760
00:43:45,058 --> 00:43:50,919
which is ironic for someone Jewish but the sausage making process

761
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,344
is ugly and it's true for almost every startup.

762
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,064
So that said, have fun with what you do.

763
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,574
I always saw being an entrepreneur as a game.

764
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,289
In my darkest moments when we had less than two weeks cash,

765
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,234
I'm like I literally thought to myself,

766
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,769
well, at least I'm going to figure out what bankruptcy is like.

767
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,089
I swear to you that crossed my mind, and it just became a game.

768
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,079
I was abstract.

769
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,164
In my own head, it was someone else's life that I was just playing.

770
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,744
If you take it too seriously as I did it when I first started,

771
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,689
like I just had way too much stress.

772
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,369
I talked to too many entrepreneurs these

773
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,214
days who internalize all those stress.

774
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,229
If you can abstract and have a bit of fun,

775
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:42,099
I think you'll enjoy it more. So thank you. Okay, great.

776
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,729
Since we only have 10 minutes left,

777
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,609
I'm just going to ask a couple of quick questions

778
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,859
and open it up to the audience.

779
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,974
So the first question to follow on that all of this

780
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:54,114
angst and anxiety that goes with running a company,

781
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,989
what's the best part?

782
00:44:58,023 --> 00:45:00,251
This is one of the questions from one of the students.

783
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:02,214
What's the best part about being an entrepreneur?

784
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:05,089
What's the best part about being a VC? Okay.

785
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,934
So it's like a roller coaster.

786
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,739
I'll start with what sucks about being a VC.

787
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,449
Well, no, let me take what's good about it.

788
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,399
I get paid to have smart people come tell me how they're going to change

789
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,479
the world and we get to debate those ideas and if I like it,

790
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,989
I can spend three weeks on it and if

791
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,824
I don't like it, I spend an hour.

792
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,954
That's great. I have no more quarterly sales targets.

793
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,224
That's kind of nice.

794
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,424
I can spend six months, nine months, 12 months making no investments.

795
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,959
I can come to Stanford and speak anytime I want and

796
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,069
there's nobody waiting back at the office saying,

797
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,694
Mark hasn't given me directions.

798
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,464
There's a lot of great things. I wrote a blog post called

799
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:44,364
"You'd have to be a pretty big baby to complain about being a VC."

800
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,659
That said, think about a roller coaster and how exciting

801
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,599
that is and it's terrifying but exciting.

802
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:54,534
Being an entrepreneur is like being on a roller coaster;

803
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,229
you get the high highs and the low lows and we don't.

804
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:00,079
We're living vicariously through you.

805
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,229
The problem with the industry is we take all the credit for your success

806
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,599
because we helped with that deal and when you guys screw up,

807
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,529
it was your fault and that's a failure

808
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,029
of the industry but it's natural.

809
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,469
It's the same way consultants and bankers act.

810
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:18,769
We don't get the high highs. We don't get them.

811
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:22,054
I would take the high highs any day of the week. Great.

812
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,229
So next question just to follow on with that

813
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:28,044
is how do you measure your success as a VC?

814
00:46:29,722 --> 00:46:33,029
Well, the interesting thing about venture capital is your

815
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:38,114
success is measured hopefully on a 7- to 10-year horizon.

816
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,239
If your performance is measured on a year or year-and-a-half

817
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,459
horizon that means you didn't do very well.

818
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,849
The majority of companies despite what you read about in TechCrunch

819
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,569
take seven to 10 years to produce huge successes.

820
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,384
My firm is the top rated firm for the year 2000.

821
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,839
If you aggregate 2000 to 2004, we're still the top firm.

822
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,064
If you take 2000 to 2008, we're the 12th best firm in the country.

823
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,749
We're the firm nobody has ever heard of.

824
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,669
They produced 15 companies worth a billion dollars

825
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,849
or more and nobody has heard of them.

826
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:12,739
Each one of those took seven, eight, nine, 10 years to mature,

827
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,679
so this idea of quick flips,

828
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,539
fail fast or whatever does not produce big results.

829
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,189
So the weird thing as a VC and I actually wrote about this,

830
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,684
people ask me on Quora if you want to go read the answer,

831
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,134
is Mark Suster a good venture capitalist?

832
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,429
I divided it into three phases of VC.

833
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:31,489
Number one is can you get a good pipeline of deals?

834
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:35,119
On that, I think I've done pretty well so I've established

835
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,889
a name for myself in three years and gotten access

836
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,774
to deal flow I think a lot of people don't.

837
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,954
Number two is do you work well with your companies?

838
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,334
Can you help them get through dark moments?

839
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,774
Can you help them get financed? Can you help them recruit talent?

840
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,294
The jury is still out on phase two but I'm in that phase.

841
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,244
I've got six portfolio companies.

842
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,399
I was up till 11:30 talking with one of

843
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,264
the CEOs last night about his problems. That's the phase I'm in.

844
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,324
The last phase is how well do you harvest your investments,

845
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,689
getting trade sales, getting exits? Are you Kleiner?

846
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,703
Can you get $400 million for ng:moco

847
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:14,504
when it probably wasn't worth it? Maybe it was worth it.

848
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:19,069
But if you're good at harvesting, you'll have good returns.

849
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,954
And in the end, I'm only judged based on returns

850
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,894
so I don't know if I'm a good VC yet.

851
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:28,129
Great. So let's take some questions from the audience. Okay, George.

852
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,704
So I have an idea about check-ins with it now.

853
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:38,189
So when you say get to know your VC or get to know your investor,

854
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,899
I guess in many senses like a lot of times,

855
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:44,924
you get one meeting with them and maybe meet with them afterwards.

856
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,739
What do you think an entrepreneur should look for in those two or three

857
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,979
weeks of hanging out and maybe getting another potential investor?

858
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,779
What should they look for in terms of what is

859
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,829
a good investor like on an experiential level,

860
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,669
not from just hearing from other people obviously?

861
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,259
I think hearing from other people is the most important

862
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:10,684
thing to be honest with you because VCs are charming;

863
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,669
not all of them but enough of them are charming

864
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:15,889
and they're all smart cut from good pedigree.

865
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:18,619
So you'll meet them, they're on their best game, best behavior.

866
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,249
You find out what they're really like from

867
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,259
other people so I would focus on that.

868
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,544
But building a relationship with a VC

869
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,569
I believe firmly in seeing them early.

870
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:32,269
Keith Rabois and I were back and forth arguing on Quora about

871
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:35,089
this and he disagrees because he says if you see them early,

872
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,689
you kind of burn out the VC and when you haven't

873
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,109
sorted out what you're going to do,

874
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:42,189
it makes it harder to go back to them.

875
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,209
That's true if you go to a full partner meeting.

876
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,759
If you go and you pitch and you flop, you're done.

877
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,329
It's hard to go back. It's true also if you overset expectations but

878
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,539
I like to say tell a VC I want to see you,

879
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,144
I'm not raising yet, I'm likely raising in nine months to 12 months.

880
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,919
We haven't changed the world yet but we have

881
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,734
some really interesting early ideas.

882
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,469
I'd like to get your thoughts and I'd like

883
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,379
to know you early so that when I'm raising,

884
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,949
you're one of the first people I call. They'd like to hear that.

885
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,399
Then you drop them little emails and don't

886
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,299
send long emails for god's sake, little emails with bullet points.

887
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,319
Just every six or eight weeks, say I wanted to update you,

888
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,999
we just got a deal signing with Zynga,

889
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,199
we hired two more people or whatever. Stay on the radar screen.

890
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,399
Find a way to say you'll have coffee

891
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,929
with them 20 minutes, 30 minutes; promise them you won't overrun.

892
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:33,509
There are some people who just have the skill despite my best

893
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,724
will to bat them away that stay on my radar screen consistently

894
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,219
and a year later when they're looking for funds,

895
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:47,394
they've got a much higher chance I think. My name is Peter Basso.

896
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,729
I'm wondering where do you see the future of VC given

897
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:55,019
that the industry seems to be somewhat saturated. Define saturated.

898
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,759
Too much money and probably too many VC firms given that

899
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,619
the business model itself isn't very profitable.

900
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,389
I disagree with your last assertion that

901
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,339
the business model is not profitable,

902
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:12,699
but let me answer the direct question and I'll talk about that.

903
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,889
If you look back to '95, '96 and '97 the venture capital industry was

904
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,509
significantly smaller than it is today.

905
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,894
'97 through 2007 it exploded at mushroom.

906
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:29,059
Venture capital funds last 10 years which strangely a 10-year

907
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,559
venture capital fund really means it last 13 years,

908
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,279
don't ask me why, but a 10-year fund last 13 years.

909
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,679
So that means if you raised '97,

910
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,659
'98, '99, 2000, 2001 even if you don't raise another fund,

911
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,329
even if you weren't so successful, you're still around.

912
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,674
Too much money in venture capital in my opinion is a problem.

913
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,859
It means you fund a lot of stupid ideas.

914
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,749
It means when you start a company, you've got four competitors,

915
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,599
each giving away product for free when they probably shouldn't be.

916
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,309
A lot of people who didn't have skills

917
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,104
to be a VC stepped into the industry.

918
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,919
So if you take the results of the last 10 years, you're right.

919
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,039
In aggregate, very poor returns, but you can't measure in aggregate.

920
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:12,179
If you look at the top tier or the top 10% or the top 15%,

921
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,514
the returns are quite good.

922
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,669
Our IRR is significantly better than the stock market.

923
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,239
So I don't think the model is broken.

924
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,949
I don't think the venture capital model is broken.

925
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,394
I don't think you can say a venture capital firm is not successful.

926
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,684
There's too much money in the industry, the industry is shrinking,

927
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,669
that's going to be a net positive I believe for the whole industry.

928
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,884
I've said publicly I think the super angel movement has the risk

929
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,469
of also expanding too fast and too much capital coming in.

930
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,629
I believe if you look at X and Y axes,

931
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:46,679
you have different points of risk and reward and return,

932
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,804
early stage investors, less money, lower price;

933
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,579
should expect to get more returns than

934
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,209
someone who's investing at late stage.

935
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,764
I think each of those markets seed A,

936
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:02,259
B, expansion, IPO ought to be a fixed size and I don't

937
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,279
know what that size is but if it expands too much then

938
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,054
in aggregate the industry doesn't do well.

939
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,179
Top tier does fine. Great. Another question?

940
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,869
Going once, going twice, okay.

941
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,369
What about VC firms that have invested in online real

942
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,679
estate and the real estate is down right now?

943
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,289
What are your thoughts about it? Who are really what's right?

944
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:24,885
Focused on online real estate company

945
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:28,506
when the real estate market is down. What's the take on that?

946
00:53:28,668 --> 00:53:34,379
Companies that focus on it, meaning people who focus on Zillow.

947
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,039
Look, I said earlier skate where the puck is going and

948
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,259
I mean it for entrepreneurs but I mean it for VCs too.

949
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:46,124
I want to invest in the things that nobody finds sexy.

950
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,339
We just invested and we haven't announced it yet in a company

951
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,209
that's trying to change the way mortgage origination works.

952
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,234
A lot of people are scared of that market.

953
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:01,109
We're looking at a secondary market for autos and for mortgages

954
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:04,119
because there's a lot of disruption in that market.

955
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,189
By the way, it's a huge market.

956
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,109
I was looking at enterprise software when

957
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,999
people said enterprise software was dead.

958
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,959
I mean, if you're skating where the puck

959
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,039
is going and investing in today's fad,

960
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,109
you're probably missing something I think.

961
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,979
I want to ask one more question. Yes, please.

962
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,199
I've got a whole long list from the students.

963
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,769
This is changing gears a little bit.

964
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,769
This is a student who wanted to know your attitude about work/life

965
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:29,119
balance because apparently you've written some things in your blogs

966
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,149
that might be a little bit conflicting about not waiting for,

967
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,259
just having a deferred life plan,

968
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,639
sort of waiting to have all the good stuff later,

969
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,079
you don't want to do that. On the other hand, you have to work like

970
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,059
crazy to make your business a success.

971
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:50,329
How do you reconcile those two? I think work/life balance is smart.

972
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:56,749
It's not easy so I often say like people

973
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,404
are on the deferred startup plan.

974
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,419
The number of people who have said to me

975
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,189
I'm thinking about being a CEO one day,

976
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,054
in fact today I had coffee with the guy,

977
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,959
I'm guessing in his late 30s,

978
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,979
and he says well, I want to try out being

979
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,639
COO one more time before I become CEO.

980
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:15,119
That's fine but there's no perfect age to be CEO.

981
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,899
There's no perfect age to do startup.

982
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,469
In fact, it's easier when you're younger.

983
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,109
I have two little kids, five and seven; I have a mortgage;

984
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,649
I have a wife. I have responsibilities;

985
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,689
I have to get home, I have to do PTA meetings.

986
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:30,339
If I look at my life when I was younger and crazy

987
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,869
and an entrepreneur and doing all this stuff,

988
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,519
it would've been pretty tough to kind of balance that

989
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,189
but part of the deferred life plan in my mind is thinking

990
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:44,579
you want to be an entrepreneur and not trying and waiting

991
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,749
because one day when I figured it all out, I'll be an entrepreneur.

992
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,159
Whatever you want to do, I think you ought to do when you're young.

993
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,649
I want to give you one example.

994
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,779
In 1994, I had been working on internet technology before

995
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,659
the internet was big and I was at the protocol layer.

996
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:06,779
We were building middleware software and I was with a group

997
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,669
of 12 people who went and established an internet practice

998
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,969
for Andersen Consulting which is now Accenture in Europe.

999
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,719
A lot of my friends quit and joined startups even in '94.

1000
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:22,629
As an ex-tech guy, I love software. I was really interested.

1001
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,959
I wanted to live in Silicon Valley,

1002
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:30,519
but my whole life I wanted to live and work in Europe and

1003
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,239
I had this offer to move to France and honestly, I chose life.

1004
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:39,199
I worked hard but I got to travel all over Europe.

1005
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,659
I lived in Barcelona, I lived in the south of France,

1006
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,009
I lived in Rome, I lived in London.

1007
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:48,249
I told a humorous story on my blog about how I decided

1008
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,039
I wanted to live in Tokyo and I just went out there

1009
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,134
without permission and made it happen.

1010
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,159
These things that I did in my life are harder for me to do now.

1011
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,929
I really want to live in China now.

1012
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,854
I have this kind of passion to live in China.

1013
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,869
It's not likely going to happen for me,

1014
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,514
at least not till my kids are through high school

1015
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,004
for a variety of reasons which I won't discuss.

1016
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:12,779
But whatever it is that you want to do, make it part of your life.

1017
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,710
That's all I think. Thank you so much. This was terrific.
