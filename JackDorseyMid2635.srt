1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,989
It brings me great pleasure to welcome to Stanford Jack Dorsey,

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,419
who is as you know, the co-founder and chairman of the

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,909
board of Twitter and the co-founder and CEO of Square.

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:25,464
Jack, welcome to Stanford. Thank you for having me.

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,309
It's an honor to be here.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,839
I get a lot of my inspiration from walking around.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,449
This is like a gorgeous campus to walk around.

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,799
I spend many hours walking around this campus,

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,259
driving down here specifically just to do so because

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,784
I was now fortunate enough to go here.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,809
I wanted to start with a story of entrepreneurship.

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,149
My father, when he was 19 years old,

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,469
he was living in St. Louis, Missouri.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,519
He was a pretty good cook. He knew how to make pizzas.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,009
He had a best friend who also knew how to cook pretty well as well.

16
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,579
So, they decided to create a company together and to call it

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,014
"Two Nice Guys". It was a pizza restaurant.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,189
I think the main reason that they started this pizza restaurant

19
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,149
is my dad is, we're from St. Louis.

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,224
So, there is a lot of meat and potatoes.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,079
So, it was a personal challenge to him to see

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,139
how much meat he could get on one pizza,

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,069
which he called the "Tim's Special".

24
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,099
They started the restaurant, it started going very well.

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,729
They needed to hire some help.

26
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,069
They made one rule before hiring wait staff.

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,219
They made the rule, "We will never date any of the wait staff."

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,019
And the next person they hired was my mom.

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,424
My dad fell in love with this woman. Her name is Marcia.

30
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,249
He went up to his best friend and said,

31
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,609
"I broke the rule. I have to quit. The company

32
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,214
is yours. And I will go marry this girl."

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,154
I was born 10 months later. So, that's how I got started.

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,409
I got started in St. Louis, Missouri.

35
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,934
It feels like a very, very small town.

36
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,749
It's actually five million people.

37
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,989
But a lot of it is spread around the metropolitan area.

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,779
My parents always stayed in the city.

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,814
They never moved out to the suburbs.

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,339
They were true believers in the city.

41
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,994
And St. Louis was one of the hardest hit cities in America,

42
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,309
apart from Detroit, in the great flight to the

43
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,664
suburbs in the '40s and '50s and the '60s.

44
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,659
When I was growing up, I was surrounded by this urban atmosphere.

45
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,419
I just loved it. My first love, I think, was the city.

46
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,409
I was walking around downtown St. Louis.

47
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,714
It was fairly desolate when I was growing up.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,674
But it was still a joy and a wonder to me.

49
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,534
You had skyscrapers and you had all of this hidden energy.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,329
Just walking around, you could feel something different.

51
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:12,149
That sort of love and that obsession was made most tangible by maps.

52
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,494
I became obsessed by maps and looking at them.

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,809
I bought every Rand McNally and every single map that I could find.

54
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,219
I would put them in my room and hang them all over the walls and just

55
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,839
look at them and wonder what was happening at this particular intersection

56
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,504
or in this area or how to get down this road most efficiently.

57
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,874
My parents didn't know what to make of it but I loved it.

58
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:44,189
In 1984-1985 we got the first Macintosh and an IBM PC Junior.

59
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:50,529
I really wanted to play more with maps. I wanted to see them.

60
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,899
I wanted to alter them more and do it on the computer screen.

61
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,219
So, I taught myself how to program because I wanted

62
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,659
to learn how to draw a map on the screen.

63
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,209
And then, I accomplished that.

64
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,379
It was very, very basic and very simple.

65
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,799
And then, I put some dots on the map.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,679
And then, I learned how to move the dots around.

67
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,989
Then, the next challenge was to figure out how to keep the dots

68
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,978
on the streets because they were going all over the place.

69
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,428
And then, I had all these dots moving around

70
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,149
this beautiful picture of this map,

71
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,959
which represented downtown St. Louis and

72
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,449
then later represented New York City, which I was amazed by.

73
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,399
The issue was that none of the dots had any meaning whatsoever.

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,964
They're just random dots moving around this city.

75
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,169
My parents had a CB radio and they had a police scanner.

76
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,099
And what was happening on the police scanner was really interesting

77
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,319
because you had ambulances and fire trucks and police cars constantly

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,409
reporting where they are and what they're doing.

79
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,874
So, I'm at Fifth in Broadway in New York City.

80
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,319
I have a patient in cardiac arrest and

81
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,919
we're going to St. John's Mercy.

82
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,839
And I could take that information,

83
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,149
type it up into a program,

84
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,719
make some assumptions about speed and direction

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,714
and what routes they're going to take and actually

86
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,989
watch the ambulance go to St. John's Mercy.

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,194
Then, I could hook up another ambulance and a taxicab,

88
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,599
a police car, a fire truck.

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,239
The more and more of this I did,

90
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,199
the more I learned how to automate more of it

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,169
because the Internet was just coming up.

92
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,275
We had Gopher and St. Louis, Missouri,

93
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,029
has a school named Washington University,

94
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,799
which was one of the first backbones for the Internet.

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,359
So, we had a pretty good connection to the BBS systems,

96
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,199
the bulletin board systems, back then.

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,339
I found all these databases of this information,

98
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,969
although this was after the fact.

99
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,769
But it was still interesting to watch and to see unfold.

100
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,149
So, now I had this picture of real-live data

101
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,829
of a real-life city operating in front of me.

102
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,729
And I just thought it was the most beautiful

103
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,589
thing ever that I could visualize, a city living and breathing.

104
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,634
I learned that the software had a name and it was called Dispatch.

105
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:16,199
I went to college. I went to University of Missouri-Rolla initially.

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,699
I was deciding between political science at the time and computer

107
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,289
science because I have always been fascinated by cities and at

108
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,899
some point want to maybe potentially go into government.

109
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,289
I'm still not quite sure if I have more effect

110
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,079
there or more effect in programming.

111
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,309
But I went away from political science because I realized

112
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,019
that there are a lot of parallels between what you do

113
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,449
in politics and what you do in government and writing

114
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,339
policy and laws and what you do in programming.

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,429
But the difference is the time scale.

116
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,409
So, I could write a policy as a senator or as a mayor

117
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,649
and I could see the effect maybe in eight years.

118
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,789
But I could write that same policy and write a simulator

119
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,699
around it and write populations around it and I could

120
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,144
see that effect instantly with a computer.

121
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,099
So, I went down the computer science route.

122
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,559
All that time I was building this dispatch system because

123
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,599
I was just fascinated by these cities and the visualizations.

124
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,139
I eventually found the largest dispatch firm

125
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,709
the world through a lot of research.

126
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,859
It was called DMS. It was in New York City.

127
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,309
They had a very, very simple website.

128
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,429
It just had their logo and the company name.

129
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,679
It had just gone public on NASDAQ.

130
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,009
I could not figure out how to contact this company.

131
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,179
I really wanted to see what they were doing

132
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,529
and I actually wanted to work for them.

133
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,939
They were running a very old version of Apache

134
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,974
and there were some holes in Apache.

135
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,204
So, I found a hole in their Web service.

136
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,829
I discovered their corporate email list.

137
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,169
I picked the email address for the CEO and the chairman.

138
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,179
And I wrote an email that said,

139
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,319
"My name is Jack Dorsey. You have a hole in your

140
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,119
website. This is how to fix it. By the way,

141
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,379
I write dispatch software." I was flown out a week later and then

142
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,514
got a job and then transferred to NYU.

143
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,429
At that point, I was living the dream.

144
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,529
I was working at the biggest dispatch from the world,

145
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,019
the biggest call center in the world,

146
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,789
and writing software to visualize New York City,

147
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,079
which was amazing to me.

148
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,229
That is really where a lot of my focus has been on.

149
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,479
It's visualizing data, visualizing information,

150
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,499
moving around in real time.

151
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,639
I took that concept and eventually in 2000 realized that I had

152
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,879
this beautiful picture of the city but it was all verticals.

153
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,899
There were no people in it. Where are all the people in the city?

154
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,869
That's when I started working on a very,

155
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,009
very simple prototype based on some inspiration from Instant Messenger

156
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,064
with the Away status and also a service called LiveJournal,

157
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,639
which was a very simple journal blogging application that allowed

158
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,254
you to compose a blog post and it would go to a friend's page.

159
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,979
I also had the first BlackBerry because

160
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,579
I was still working in dispatch at the time.

161
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,624
It was called the RIM 850. It was basically just an email pager.

162
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,399
But what it allowed is I could be anywhere in the world,

163
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,339
anywhere in the city, and I could share what I was doing and maybe

164
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,529
I could also see what other people were doing.

165
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,449
So, I wrote some very simple software to receive an

166
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,109
email from my BlackBerry and then send it out to an

167
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,069
email list of some people I put on that list,

168
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,339
with my friends and my family on it. I got that done in about a day.

169
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,849
Then, I went out to Golden Gate Park and I went to the Bison Paddock.

170
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,709
We do have live bison in San Francisco, if you haven't seen it.

171
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,999
They're awesome.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,369
And I typed out an email that said,

173
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,354
"I'm at Golden Gate Park watching the bison."

174
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,614
It went out to my service and was broadcast out to all these people.

175
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,029
I immediately recognized two things. First, no one cared what I was doing.

176
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,029
[Laughter]

177
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,784
Second, no one else had a BlackBerry.

178
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,889
So, I was alone in my sharing and also receiving.

179
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,829
So, I was getting no information back.

180
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,309
Wrong time, good idea, put it on the shelf.

181
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,429
I continued to contract around dispatch.

182
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,579
I got into a lot of lower-level medical systems.

183
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,739
If you ever take a boat to Alcatraz to go on the Blue & Gold Fleet,

184
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,349
I wrote the ticketing system for that.

185
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,329
So, just random contract jobs until

186
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,074
I discovered this company called Odeo, which was run by Evan Williams.

187
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,289
Biz Stone was joining in a few months.

188
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,289
It was a consumer podcasting company.

189
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,209
I had never written a resume before.

190
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,929
I had no interest in podcasting whatsoever.

191
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,999
But I was a really good programmer and I wanted

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,329
to understand the consumer side of the Internet.

193
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,729
A lot of what I was doing was in the back end.

194
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,859
While it would touch my mom and her life,

195
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,699
it would be so in an indirect way.

196
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,539
My mom may take a taxicab in New York City and may touch my software

197
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,569
or buy a ticket to Alcatraz and may touch my software.

198
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,069
But it wasn't direct.

199
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,119
I wanted to learn about being more direct in interaction.

200
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,534
So, I went to work with Ev and Biz.

201
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,099
I quickly learned that no one else there enjoyed podcasting, either.

202
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,509
So, no one was really excited to build the product or

203
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,069
build the tool and they weren't consumers of the tool.

204
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,709
So, we weren't building something that we loved to use.

205
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,049
So, quite an interesting situation which

206
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,569
allowed for other ideas to bubble up.

207
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:06,729
In late 2005, early 2006, we all broke up into separate groups.

208
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,979
We were given an assignment to come up with

209
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,709
an idea of something you'd like to work on.

210
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,844
The first thing that came to my mind was this idea back in 2000.

211
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,739
But now in 2005-2006, we had the SMS.

212
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,459
I could actually send an SMS message from Cingular to Verizon.

213
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,709
That was very, very new to the United States.

214
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,039
I was in love with the technology.

215
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,319
It degrades gracefully to every single device,

216
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,204
even the cheapest devices.

217
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,829
And it has this beautiful constraint of 160 characters.

218
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,769
It doesn't really work all the time.

219
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,559
It's really rough around the edges. I love stuff like that.

220
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,779
So, I brought up this idea,

221
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,799
"What if we could just use SMS? You could send what

222
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,179
you're doing. It will go out in real time to all the

223
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,309
people who are interested in hearing it. And then,

224
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,659
it would be archived on the Web. You could also enter

225
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,809
it from the Web and it would be device-agnostic.

226
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,079
It would be a whole thing. It would be awesome."

227
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,699
My two other people in the park, we were on a playground,

228
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,699
said it was a good idea.

229
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,029
We presented it to the company. It took about a week.

230
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,909
But then, the company finally got behind it.

231
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,384
I was given two weeks and one other programmer

232
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,239
in Biz Stone to write the software. And we did it.

233
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:26,839
At the end of that two weeks, I wrote the first tweet,

234
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,714
which was inviting coworkers.

235
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,544
And then, all the Odeo coworkers came on; they loved it.

236
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,689
And little by little,

237
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,979
we took from that company and we bought them on the Twitter project

238
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,044
until we spun it out as a separate company and sold off Odeo.

239
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,174
So, that's how that sort of visualization and early

240
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,189
desire to see the world led into Twitter,

241
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,174
which is still a desire for me.

242
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,554
Now we have more and more people using it all over the world.

243
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,419
And it's even faster to see what's happening

244
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,924
and what's unfolding in the world.

245
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,719
But it really comes down to that curiosity about what's happening right

246
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,949
now everywhere and really being the pulse of what's happening right

247
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,839
now everywhere and being able to point to every single medium.

248
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,119
In 2008 I stepped into the chairman role of Twitter.

249
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,649
There was an interesting thing that was happening.

250
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,619
The entire market was crashing.

251
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,889
So, all of these financial obstructions that we

252
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,499
had built up were suddenly being swept away.

253
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,239
There is no better time to start a new company or a

254
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,109
new idea than a depression or recession because a lot

255
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,029
of the management teams were being asked to leave.

256
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,164
There is a lot of people who need to get really creative

257
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,749
to create something new and there was an opening.

258
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,699
There was an opening particularly in payments.

259
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,619
At this time, I also reconnected with

260
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,144
my first boss when I was 15 years old.

261
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,434
His name is Jim McKelvey. He is a glass artist.

262
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,889
He makes these beautiful pieces of glass.

263
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,749
We reconnected over Christmas.

264
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,839
I normally go home for Christmas and visit my family.

265
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,769
We got to talking. He wanted to build an electronic car company.

266
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,659
I said, "I have no idea how to do that but it's

267
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,399
an interesting idea. But let's keep talking.

268
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,364
We should definitely work together on something."

269
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,434
Then, one day he called me up on his iPhone. I picked up my iPhone.

270
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,479
He was frustrated because he just lost a sale of a $2000 piece of

271
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,339
glass that he had just made because the woman who wanted to pay

272
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,029
him only had a credit card and he couldn't accept credit card.

273
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,614
We were both wondering,

274
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,979
you have this general purpose computer next to your ear,

275
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,279
why were you not able to make that sale?

276
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,389
We decided that he would come out. We would take a month.

277
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,929
We would hire one other programmer to work on

278
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,119
the client's site and build a hardware out,

279
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,254
I would build the server software and then answer that question.

280
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,199
In a month we built a very early prototype

281
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,949
of what is now known as Square,

282
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,409
which is a credit card reader that plugs into the

283
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,449
audio jack of your iPhone or your android or your

284
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,029
iPad or anything that has an audio jack.

285
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,679
We just need to write software for it.

286
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,139
The software and the hardware was really easy.

287
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,679
We got that done in about a month.

288
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,249
I could actually swipe a card and generate electronic

289
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,519
receipt via email and then send it out to a person.

290
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,659
I love this because I would go around to all these angel investors

291
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,679
and VCs and charge them $5 or $50 to show them my new idea.

292
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,279
I made $600 from that, by the way.

293
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,319


294
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,549
It was awesome.

295
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:57,769
But a month later, after we had that prototype,

296
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,324
Jim started reading the Visa regulations.

297
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,659
He said, "Wait a minute. This is against

298
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,189
the rules. We can't do this."

299
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,629
And here, we had built all the software,

300
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,149
we built the hardware and we had a great understanding

301
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,129
of the payments world coming from nowhere,

302
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,339
like I had no understanding of the

303
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,174
financial world before this moment.

304
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,729
We decided to push through and show this to Visa and

305
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,279
show this to MasterCard and show this to AmEx.

306
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,839
The thing that really inspires people is a working product.

307
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,384
When you're pitching someone,

308
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,239
the best thing you can do is show them something that works.

309
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,469
We did this with Twitter. We had a great number of users.

310
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,089
We had a great number of mass. We had a lot of used cases.

311
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,489
And we had investors who were coming to us

312
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,334
who were already users of the product.

313
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,449
Their families were users of the product.

314
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,214
So, the story became very, very easy to tell.

315
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,699
They could easily see why this was something that was powerful.

316
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,269
Square was the same but it was a little bit more

317
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,959
tangible because I could actually take their credit

318
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,464
card and take money off of it and then say,

319
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,744
"Go to your Chase account right now and look

320
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,989
because I just took $3 from your account,"

321
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,359
or in some cases $50 if I don't really like the VC.

322
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,974
But the interesting thing I realized along the way

323
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,309
is that payment is another form of communication.

324
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,909
It's another exchange of value.

325
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,369
The really interesting thing about payments in the

326
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,689
financial world is no one has really designed it.

327
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,329
If you think about it, every single person in this world has some

328
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,819
connection to money, they all hate it.

329
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,629
At some point or another, you're going to hate some aspect of money.

330
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,939
So, there has never been anyone who has really designed a payments

331
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,619
platform or an exchange of value or a currency that's really

332
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,659
beautiful and that's really thoughtful and that engages a user

333
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:08,849
experience around communication instead of purely the service

334
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,199
and the mechanics of transferring the value.

335
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,289
So, when we were building Square, we realized that,

336
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:19,149
"Wow! The receipt is something that has never really

337
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,509
been designed or looked at. I go up to a coffee

338
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,839
store and I hand them my credit card. I say,

339
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,994
"I want a cappuccino." I hand them my credit card.

340
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,429
And they type in "cappuccino" on a little terminal,

341
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,824
which is basically a calculator on top of the cash box,

342
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,609
and then they get $3.24 from that. They get a receipt.

343
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,894
Then, they take that amount and they go over and they

344
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,499
type that amount into the credit card terminal.

345
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,109
Then, they swipe the card and then they get that receipt.

346
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,509
And then, they hand me that receipt and I sign for

347
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,374
that receipt and then I give it back to them.

348
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,909
And then, they take that receipt, take the other receipt,

349
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,519
staple it together with a little coffee card and then

350
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,709
give me all that and I throw that paper away.

351
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,139
It's useless.

352
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:08,999
It would be so easy if you built a cohesive system that carries

353
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,899
the entire transaction to create a receipt that is useful.

354
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,804
With one swipe, I can sign on electronic screen,

355
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,489
get rid of paper completely.

356
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:26,004
But with that one swipe, I learn of the merchant's Twitter handle.

357
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,379
I learn of their Facebook page. I learn of their Yelp account.

358
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,689
I learn of their menu,

359
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,274
their hours, whatever they want to put on their receipt,

360
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:39,229
they can put there. It can be used as a publishing medium and

361
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,819
something that you can interact with,

362
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,289
instead of something that is a burden to receive.

363
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:52,889
And a lot of retailers out there are embarrassed by the receipts they

364
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,329
give out and the whole payment processing aspect of their business.

365
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,389
They go above and beyond to craft a beautiful experience in their

366
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,684
store and they have to compromise to accept credit cards.

367
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,514
They have to compromise to accept any form of payment.

368
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,449
And then, what do they get out of it?

369
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,469
If you go to any coffee store in America and you ask them,

370
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,544
"How many cappuccinos did you sell today?"

371
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,219
apart from Starbucks and Pete's, "I don't know, we made $300."

372
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,929
How many cappuccinos did you sell?

373
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,379
And then, what percentage of these people bought biscottis?

374
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,589
What happens when it's a rainy day?

375
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,219
What happens on Tuesday at 5:00 p.m.?

376
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,259
All this data were used for Google Analytics.

377
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,209
We've used these effectively to build our electronic systems

378
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,659
and our blogs and all of these companies that we're building.

379
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,914
But real-world offline merchants have none of this data.

380
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,819
They can buy into it if they buy into a $15,000

381
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,229
point-of-sales system.

382
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,479
But then, they would also need to buy into an entire

383
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,999
service army of people to figure out how to use it.

384
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,959
So, what we want to do is we want to build a full point-of-sales

385
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,529
system that is just gorgeous and that allows and enables

386
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,229
someone to immediately not just make the transaction

387
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,519
fast and feel great but to get very,

388
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,149
very rich data for everything that they're selling,

389
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:27,089
Google Analytics type of data for everything that they're selling.

390
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,079
This becomes really,

391
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,509
really important, not just when you're starting a business

392
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,249
but when you're trying to grow that business.

393
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,239
This is true for every single startup and every single thing we do.

394
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,269
And one of my greatest lessons that I learned in starting

395
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,049
and running Twitter and starting and running Square was

396
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,714
how important it is to instrument all usage.

397
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,369
You have to instrument everything.

398
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:58,049
For the first two years of Twitter's life, we were flying blind.

399
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,459
We had no idea what was going on with the network.

400
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,964
We had no idea what was going on with the system,

401
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,069
with how people were using it. We were making guesses.

402
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,299
We were basing everything on intuition instead of

403
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,739
having a good balance between intuition and data.

404
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,264
We were going down all the time because of it,

405
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,389
because we could not see what was happening.

406
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,804
So, the first thing I wrote for Square

407
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,329
on the server was an admin dashboard.

408
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,669
We have a very, very strong discipline within the company,

409
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,509
which is now 72 people,

410
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,489
to log everything, to measure everything and to test everything.

411
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,419
We treat the dashboard, we treat the analytics,

412
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,649
we treat the data as a product. We call it the inference team.

413
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:45,599
Their job is to instrument all usage and infer all action.

414
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,109
That's something that we need.

415
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,919
But it's also something that our users need.

416
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,184
All that data is really, really interesting.

417
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,919
It speaks to a market that has never really been addressed.

418
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,239
Ninety-four percent of commerce is still offline.

419
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,859
Only 6% has moved online.

420
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:12,049
So, it's a massive, massive market and they have no tools whatsoever.

421
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:17,449
The data has been really important.

422
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:24,489
But I think one of the biggest things that has helped me is learning

423
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:31,004
how to become a better storyteller and the power of a story.

424
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,949
And by this, I mean if you want to build a product and

425
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,619
you want to build a product that is relevant to folks,

426
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,069
you need to put yourself in their shoes and

427
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,149
you need to write a story from their side.

428
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,859
So, we spend a lot of time writing what's called

429
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,604
user narratives of this user or this person.

430
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,559
He is in the middle of Chicago and they go

431
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,434
to a coffee store in the middle of Chicago.

432
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,564
This is the experience they're going to have. It reads like a play.

433
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,809
It's really, really beautiful.

434
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,779
If you do that story well, then all of the prioritization,

435
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,289
all of the product, all of the design and all the coordination

436
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:22,684
that you need to do with these products just falls out naturally

437
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,699
because you can edit the story and everyone can relate to

438
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,239
the story from all levels of the organization,

439
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,279
engineers to operations to support to designers

440
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,604
to the business side of the house.

441
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,844
So, that story is very, very important for us.

442
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,589
And really constantly considering the story and

443
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,239
what new twists and elements we need to add to

444
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,299
the story are a pretty big deal for us as well.

445
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,674
And we want to tell an epic story.

446
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,849
We want to solve a really big problem.

447
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,774
We don't want to have a bunch of short stories strung together.

448
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,889
We want one epic cohesive story that we tell the world.

449
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:07,034
And both Twitter and Square are driving towards this goal.

450
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:14,369
So, number 2, good storytelling and writing stories for the users.

451
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,959
The third thing is as I see my role as CEO of Square.

452
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,249
My role, I think of it as an editorial function.

453
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,939
It's funny because Square, our headquarters are actually in the

454
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,844
San Francisco Chronicle Building.

455
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,609
The paper is not doing so well so they're

456
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,329
moving out and we're moving in.

457
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,239
We're also right next to the United States Mint.

458
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,319
So, it's a very auspicious location for a payments company.

459
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,369
But by editorial, I mean there are a thousand things that we could

460
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,709
be doing but there's only one or two that are important.

461
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,489
All of these ideas and all of these stories from our users,

462
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,229
from engineers, from support people,

463
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:07,139
from designers are going to constantly flood what we should be doing.

464
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,899
We need to choose the one or two that are really going to drive

465
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,829
and sustain the network and the service and the product.

466
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:19,019
As an editor, I am effectively just the chief editor of the company.

467
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,119
As an editor, I'm constantly taking all these inputs

468
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,834
and deciding on that one or that intersection of

469
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,209
a few that makes sense for what we're doing.

470
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,994
There's three access points that I pay attention to, in particular.

471
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,819
Number 1 is the team.

472
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,859
We have to bring the best people in,

473
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,149
edit the best people in so we have a good cast of characters,

474
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,249
and edit away any negative elements.

475
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,209
A lot of this is just like the timing is off

476
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,736
and our relationship just doesn't match.

477
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:56,439
In some cases, we have to ask people

478
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,529
to leave or they leave on their own.

479
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,369
But it's always minding that team dynamic

480
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,024
because at the end of the day,

481
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,859
we're just a group of people working on one single goal.

482
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,514
If we can't step in a cohesive coordinated fashion,

483
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,424
then we're going to trip all over the place.

484
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,508
And that's a messy company. No one wants to use that.

485
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,664
So, recruiting is number 1.

486
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,594
Number 2 is internal and external communication.

487
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,829
Internal communication is just the coordination around

488
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,149
what we're doing and why we're doing it and what our

489
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,489
goals are and why the goals are like that. That's it.

490
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,809
If you have that sort of high-level, this is where we're going,

491
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,214
this is the vision, this is the next 30 days and

492
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,814
three months and six months and a year maybe,

493
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,469
it makes it very, very easy to set priorities and for all of the edges

494
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,949
of the company to set their own priorities to do the right thing.

495
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,839
The external communication is the product.

496
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,769
The product is the story we're telling the world.

497
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,659
We want to put everything through this.

498
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,849
We don't want it to be about a person.

499
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,739
We want it to be about how people are using it and how people are

500
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,319
fitting it into their lives and what they're doing with it.

501
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,259
That's the strongest story we have.

502
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,339
So, number 2 is that internal and external communication.

503
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,594
Number 3 is editing the money in the bank story.

504
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,219
This comes in two ways.

505
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,049
It comes through investment and taking money from investors,

506
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,439
either through swiping their credit cards while

507
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,369
they're not looking or through revenue.

508
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,309
Fortunately, Square is a company that has revenue from day 1

509
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,509
so we can look at constantly building that and

510
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,319
we don't have to worry about much investment.

511
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,609
We can focus on that revenue piece.

512
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:49,874
So, my three priorities and my focus areas are in that order.

513
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,169
That's what I'm constantly editing as a CEO.

514
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:01,139
I think it makes managing a growing company

515
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,519
and a fast-paced movement very,

516
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,439
very easy because there is basically one thing that you have to do.

517
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,989
You have to make every single detail perfect

518
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,349
and you have to limit the number of details.

519
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,704
That's it. Every detail perfect, limit the number of details.

520
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,549
If you can do that well,

521
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,759
no matter where you are in the org structure,

522
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,519
no matter where you are in the company or organization,

523
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,869
you're going to succeed because you're paying

524
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,199
attention to the smallest things.

525
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,579
And if you pay attention to the smallest

526
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,949
things while knowing what's important,

527
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,599
then everything else takes care of itself.

528
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,980
I have gotten a lot from those few things.

529
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,879
That's what has guided my career.

530
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,749
I'm always looking for that cohesive end to

531
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,839
the story and how everything wraps back around.

532
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,659
As an example of this,

533
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:07,339
I found recently, about three or four months ago,

534
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,609
that my father's pizza restaurant still exists.

535
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:18,379
I found about it because there is this account on Twitter.

536
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,519
It was Pie Pizzeria.

537
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,724
They tweeted, "Hey, Jack. I think I bought your father's company.

538
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:29,509
We're using Square to sell all of our pizzas,"

539
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,529
which is awesome. So, it just all loops back around.

540
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,489
That is the moment that we're all building for.

541
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,059
That's why we do what we do and why we work so

542
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,284
hard to build what we want to see in the world.

543
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,969
It's for moments like that.

544
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,129
It's not for moments where I say,

545
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,159
"Hey, Mom, go down the street to this particular

546
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,339
coffee store and you'll see Square,

547
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,969
this new thing that I'm working on."

548
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,049
It's my mom texting me randomly,

549
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,659
she does it all the time, and saying,

550
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,669
"Hey, Jack, I used Square at this random

551
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,139
place that I just showed up at." That's the magic moment.

552
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,834
It really reminds me of one of my favorite quotes of all time.

553
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,099
I'm not really sure who said it but

554
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,269
it's in a Lynda Barry novel called "Cruddy".

555
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,719
I think it speaks very highly of what we all do as entrepreneurs

556
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,489
and what we all do as creators and builders of things.

557
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,776
Everyone in this room captures it perfectly. And the quote is,

558
00:32:33,876 --> 00:32:44,230
"Expect the unexpected and whenever possible, be the unexpected."

559
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,644
I try to live by that on a daily basis.

560
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,769
So, with that, I would love to open the floor to questions and spend

561
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,964
the next 30 minutes talking about whatever you want to talk about.

562
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:03,779
Jack, the first question is actually from...

563
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,612
My name is Jessie Juusola, and I'm the TA for the class

564
00:33:06,712 --> 00:33:09,638
the spirit of entrepreneurship, MS&E 178.

565
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,009
We meet on Mondays to prep for this lecture

566
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,549
and then we meet on Wednesdays to debrief.

567
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,339
So, for the first question,

568
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,889
if someone from the class has a question and wants to ask it?

569
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,535
One there. We got one? Yeah.

570
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:27,019
Just from researching Square,

571
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,079
I'm just curious what your marketing strategy is going forward.

572
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,609
I know you probably can't reveal that but I heard about Vodaphone's

573
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,094
payware and for similar products that are also being put out that

574
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,219
don't have hardware on iPhone and things like that.

575
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,659
I'm just curious what your marketing strategy is going forward,

576
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,424
given the idea of this market is growing.

577
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,029
More people are trying to add products.

578
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,379
Well, number 1, the marketing strategy.

579
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,914
We have not done any marketing whatsoever just yet.

580
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,259
So, a lot of it has been word of mouth.

581
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:07,029
By the way, starting a startup after Twitter is so much easier than before

582
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:11,149
because you have an amazing way not just to promote the product but you

583
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,159
get instant feedback of what people are feeling about it and what they

584
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,099
like and they dislike and you can react very quickly to that.

585
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:25,939
But what we're trying to do now is identify the key influencers

586
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,639
in those merchant areas and make them distribution points.

587
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,914
For instance, there's 5000 taco trucks in Los Angeles

588
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,354
and 300 people a day go to each one of those.

589
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,934
Ten to thirty percent of those people have their own small business.

590
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,609
This is not just small businesses.

591
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,899
This is individual services like teaching piano

592
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,849
or cutting someone's grass or a hairstylist.

593
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:57,129
So, it doesn't make sense to ship 200 Squares to

594
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,099
these 5000 taco trucks and allow them to give these

595
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:06,069
away for free or with the purchase of a taco. We think it does.

596
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,759
And then, people discover,

597
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,224
"Well, this is interesting but how can I use it?"

598
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,859
And then, suddenly I need to sell my MacBook Air on Craigslist

599
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,289
and I can take the person's credit card instead of having

600
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:22,149
them bring $1200 to me or whatever I'm selling it for.

601
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,919
That's how we're thinking about it right now.

602
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,479
A lot of the way I think about marketing

603
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,899
is through the product itself.

604
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,874
So, I think the marketing function,

605
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,179
the best aspect and the best it can do is

606
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,859
surface the product as much as possible.

607
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,334
And to do that, we're doing this taco truck thing and we're also

608
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,069
purchasing Facebook ads and Google ads and doing the standard thing

609
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:55,219
and looking into print media and the Union of Accountants because

610
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,094
they might be influencers and their trade magazines.

611
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,729
So, it surfaces the product. And then, the product takes over.

612
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,849
So, if the product is built in a beautiful way,

613
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,669
it just inspires people hopefully to take action.

614
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,289
We have about three to five seconds to inspire

615
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,434
someone to take action to actually get Square.

616
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,149
And then, we have about a week to get them to participate

617
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,089
more and that's by taking in transaction.

618
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,199
A lot of our users are not just accepting credit

619
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,689
cards but they're also accepting cash.

620
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,989
We realize with a receipt that it's great that we're sending electronic

621
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,199
receipts through email and SMS for credit card payments.

622
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,879
But a lot of people still pay with cash so why

623
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,979
can't we offer those receipts for cash as well?

624
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,264
Then, we're like, "Oh, we can be payment device-agnostic."

625
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,694
We don't have to worry about that.

626
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,749
So, we have about a week to get them to participate more and

627
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,834
then about a month to get them to be users forevermore.

628
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,759
That's the phasing that we think about.

629
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,849
In terms of other competitors,

630
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,359
the magical thing about Square is not just the

631
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,009
hardware that it's so small and it's free.

632
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,719
The app is free and the hardware is free and there

633
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,259
is no setup cost and all these other things.

634
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,629
But typically, when you go to accept credit cards,

635
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,974
you have to get a merchant account.

636
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,049
It's called a merchant account,

637
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,779
which is a relationship with the bank,

638
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,349
which has all these setup fees that has monthly minimums,

639
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:28,249
that has a monthly fee. It has a one- to two-year contract.

640
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,829
And then, they tell you that you're going to be paying 1.79%

641
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,659
to accept credit cards and there's a little asterisk next to it.

642
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,149
The little asterisk goes to "for qualified cards only",

643
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,299
which represents a very, very small amount of cards actually used.

644
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,654
So, the merchants are actually paying 3 to 3.5%

645
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,539
and 50 cents on every single transaction.

646
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,504
They have no idea they're doing that.

647
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,769
And so, at the end of the month,

648
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,869
when they get the merchant's statement,

649
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,289
the bank comes in and takes the money out.

650
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,545
And if they don't have enough money in, then they get an overdraft.

651
00:37:56,645 --> 00:38:03,599
It's a mess and it's almost criminal. We're changing all that.

652
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,119
We're making it a lot more transparent.

653
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,289
We're not just focused on the hardware.

654
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:10,339
So, the difference between us and those other competitors

655
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,399
that you named is that we're focused on the software.

656
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,644
We think the software experience is what can be beautiful.

657
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:21,159
We think all of the data around the transaction is really,

658
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,749
really interesting and something our users can do a lot with,

659
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,599
something their users, who are the payers, can do a lot with

660
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,449
and something we can do a lot with.

661
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,109
Do you have any plans of breaking into retail

662
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,199
merchants like Whole Foods, Safeway and such?

663
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,089
So, the question is,

664
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,519
"Do you have any plans to go to larger retail institutions?"

665
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:55,269
I really like building utilities.

666
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,299
I like building utilities that scale from individual

667
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,689
use all the way up to a larger use.

668
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,124
You see this with Twitter,

669
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,899
with people using it to talk about what they're having for breakfast,

670
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:16,664
which is something that I do. It's meaningless to 99.9999%

671
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,749
of the people in the world but it's

672
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,109
extremely meaningful to my mother.

673
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:28,219
So, it's a good use case. You have businesses using it.

674
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,969
You have governments using it. And we see Square in the same way.

675
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:38,009
You can use it to get your rent money or to tutor someone

676
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,229
and get paid for that or sell something on Craigslist.

677
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,269
But you can also use it in a retail environment.

678
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,639
We have retailers in New York City who have multiple

679
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,679
iPod touches and now they're just replicating the

680
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,769
Apple Store and the Apple Store experience.

681
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:58,279
They're bringing the point of purchase to the decision.

682
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,134
So, they don't have anyone lining up behind the cash register.

683
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,769
Again, the experience feels awesome.

684
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:08,544
That's the other thing about utilities.

685
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,109
The more you can minimize the thinking

686
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,399
around the mechanics in the moment,

687
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,739
then more people are going to use it,

688
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,119
more people are going to feel good about it.

689
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,769
In Square's case, it's really focused on we're going to get

690
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,669
you to the value of what you're actually intending to purchase

691
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,759
or the service that you're intending to purchase and get

692
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,414
all the mechanics of the payments out of the way.

693
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,109
You can go home with the receipt and then you

694
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,464
can interact with it there if you want.

695
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,039
But you came for a cappuccino. You should get a cappuccino.

696
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,749
You shouldn't have to worry about taking out your credit

697
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,529
card and doing all this mess and like having to do something

698
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,014
with three pieces of paper that you have no use for.

699
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,979
So, yes, we are very interested in the retail

700
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,339
merchants and the larger merchants.

701
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:00,119
The thing about the larger merchants is they're very stubborn and they have a lot invested

702
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,444
in their systems and they're very stubborn to change.

703
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:09,884
So, our thinking around that is we're going to build them an API.

704
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,369
We're going to introduce them to it. We're going to see what works.

705
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,129
We're going to be focused entirely on payments. We'll fit in.

706
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,199
We're going to make sense.

707
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,829
And then, we disappear when they have to go back to their system.

708
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,269
But we don't want to build inventory

709
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,219
systems or anything like that.

710
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,320
Do you have a way to let you break into those big accounts,

711
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,127
like Whole Foods, Safeway, how could you connect?

712
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:37,515
What's that? How could we connect? You and I personally? Yes.

713
00:41:37,615 --> 00:41:40,963
I'll give you my email address afterwards.

714
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:46,902
Am I choosing random people? Yeah, whatever you want.

715
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:47,833
OK.

716
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,719
You said that along your journey,

717
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,394
you had become a better storyteller.

718
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,129
And I would argue that you've become really good at

719
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,954
it through here and through seeing some interviews.

720
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,969
I just want you to tell us a little bit more

721
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,992
about how you learned to become a very good storyteller.

722
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:04,604
That's a great question.

723
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:12,579
The biggest thing for me on that path is I needed to draw

724
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,569
something out and I needed to get it out of my head.

725
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,904
I found myself very early on thinking about something,

726
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:23,279
like thinking about this early idea for Twitter and saying to myself,

727
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,459
"I could build this."

728
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,089
You have those shower moments or you're walking at midnights in some

729
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,209
town in New York City and you've got this amazing brand-new ideas.

730
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,489
And then, you start thinking,

731
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,874
"Well, I could really start doing this if only

732
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,179
X and if I had this person or if this technology

733
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,059
existed or if this happened or this happened."

734
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,839
What I realized I was doing is I was constantly

735
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,869
making excuses for not working on it.

736
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,429
And then, the window had passed and then I couldn't do anything.

737
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,788
I think it's really, really important

738
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:59,169
to write it out or to draw it out or to code it.

739
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,399
But you need to get it out of your head.

740
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,519
The reason you have to get it out of your head is you need

741
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,929
to be able to see it on a surface that is not in your mind.

742
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,909
Once you can see it and once you can step back from it,

743
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,194
then you can also decide,

744
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:17,454
"This pass is my filter. This pass is my constraint.

745
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,299
So, maybe I can show it and share it with some other people."

746
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,019
Then, they'll be like, "That's the stupidest idea ever,"

747
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,339
or "That's somewhat interesting but maybe this and this and this."

748
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,579
So, the sooner you can do that,

749
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,619
then you have a lot of momentum around it.

750
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,739
You can really decide if you want to commit to it and work

751
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,389
on it more and put it on a shelf for a later date.

752
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,299
The realization that I think everyone needs

753
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,029
to have about that latter option,

754
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,489
putting it on the shelf, is that you can come back to it.

755
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,759
It will surface back up in another piece of work

756
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,569
or another idea at some point in your life.

757
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:01,414
Having that ability to close off a chapter

758
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:04,484
and move on is really, really important.

759
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,269
You can't have all these open threads.

760
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,289
That's what I realized I was doing.

761
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,579
That also encouraged me to really write more

762
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,559
and to really think about what is the story,

763
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,369
how are people coming to this and like when I show my friends this,

764
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,289
how are they going to react.

765
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,598
I would write it down. I would actually treat it like a play.

766
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:30,129
When I realized that I was writing plays,

767
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,559
I read a lot more plays for style and

768
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,229
for substance and for technique. I think it's really good.

769
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,549
I think there is another company that I've

770
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,824
always looked towards for inspiration.

771
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,779
I know a number of people in this room probably have

772
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,814
the similar company in mind, which is Apple.

773
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,184
Apple, I think, is run like a theater company.

774
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,459
It has a great sense of pacing. It has a great sense of story.

775
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:04,734
It has a great sense of execution. It's all event-driven.

776
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,104
It's all stage-driven,

777
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,169
the stage being a billboard and the stage being

778
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,689
a keynote or the stage being a product launch.

779
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,369
All of it has a very, very cohesive end-to-end story.

780
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,059
I mean, you think about what happened when

781
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,179
Steve Jobs came back to the company.

782
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,609
The first thing he did is he killed every

783
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,019
product line the company was working on.

784
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,604
For two years they had no product on the market whatsoever.

785
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,379
All they had were a bunch of posters all

786
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,664
around the world with Steve's heroes. It said, "Think different."

787
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,249
It was just focused on bringing up the brand and

788
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,329
making people wear the brand again and how the brand

789
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:45,579
is aligning to this particular feeling and story.

790
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,009
And then, they came out with the iMac and

791
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,784
then built iTunes and then the iPod.

792
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,394
They realized, "Wait a minute. People are

793
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,109
carrying music on their phones now.

794
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,904
So, we better build a phone, iPhone."

795
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:04,169
So, this unfolding of the plot and the epic story has been very,

796
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:08,369
very interesting to watch, especially if you look back to that time

797
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,979
when he came back to the company.

798
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,409
So, I have learned a lot from that company and other

799
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,609
companies who operate in a similar fashion.

800
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,809
Thank you so much.

801
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,629
I actually was really appreciating the fact that you

802
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,799
shared the story of how you started from childhood.

803
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,939
It's also good to know that I'm not the

804
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,214
only who has ideas in New York City,

805
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,619
which I don't have in San Francisco, not really.

806
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,829
I'm really curious about this merchant account

807
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,064
that you're talking about before.

808
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,449
I mean, are you basically becoming an acquiring bank?

809
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,689
How are you giving merchant account to people?

810
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:50,559
We're doing some interesting things. We are an aggregator.

811
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,209
There was another company that was an aggregator

812
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:58,249
before us and that was PayPal. We learned a lot from PayPal.

813
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,499
PayPal paved the way for what we're doing and

814
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,779
made it a lot easier for what we're doing.

815
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,999
The other thing that made things easier

816
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,919
for us is I hired Keith Rabois,

817
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,649
who was working at PayPal in the early days.

818
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:15,779
He was the one that went to Capitol Hill and lobbied against these

819
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,054
other organizations that were trying to shut PayPal down.

820
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,549
He is now our COO. He has a good understanding of how to get

821
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,984
through a lot of these complexities.

822
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,199
But when we first saw the merchant account,

823
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,249
it was funny because we actually built a software

824
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,909
and then we needed the payment back in.

825
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:34,039
We were like, "How do we get a merchant account?"

826
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,564
It is a nightmare to figure out how to

827
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,114
get one of these things these days.

828
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:42,499
We went to rockbottommerchantaccounts.com

829
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,529
and we signed up for a merchant account as a glass artist.

830
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,624
We said, "We are selling glass." We created a company to do it.

831
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,864
It's called JDJM, which are the initials of my co-founder and I.

832
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,779
We were passed off to this other organization

833
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,779
with a cue and they told us a different price.

834
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,409
And then, we were passed off to another organization and they

835
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,469
had another different price and another infrastructure.

836
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,379
It was just a mess.

837
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,949
But it was so inspiring to see that because we were like,

838
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,594
"We can simplify this."

839
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:17,259
There is no reason that this needs to exist in the world.

840
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:22,069
That goes back to the editorial. It's not what we can build.

841
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,594
It's what we can take away.

842
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,559
All the things that we can take away from this world

843
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,534
are going to be the things that drive adoption.

844
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:33,099
We were going to our partners and we were showing

845
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,569
this to all these financial institutions.

846
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,309
And we were like, "We're giving this away for free. We're

847
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:41,789
giving the software away for free. We are not going to

848
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,329
have any sort of merchant account. We're not going to

849
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,109
have any monthly fees or any of those things."

850
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:51,619
And the first thing they said to us literally was,

851
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,369
"You're being really stupid. You're leaving money on the

852
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,839
table. People are used to paying for these things."

853
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:02,239
We said, "Well, that's probably why you only have seven

854
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,634
million people processing credit cards with you today."

855
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,239
We can bring that number way, way up.

856
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,469
We can enable everyone to accept a form of payment that every single

857
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,314
person in this country is carrying around in their pocket,

858
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,849
from a credit card to a debit card to a gift card to a prepaid card.

859
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,154
Everyone knows exactly what this is and how to use it.

860
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,909
So, we don't need to train the users with a new user behavior.

861
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,449
They can use what they know.

862
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,879
They can use the devices that they have in their pockets today,

863
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,009
the simple tools that they have in their

864
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,619
pockets to do everything they need to do.

865
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:39,339
It doesn't require anything from the payer's side.

866
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,009
The merchant account was the first to go.

867
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,699
We're the only one that doesn't require a merchant account.

868
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,349
The way we have set that up structurally is

869
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,809
we have to work with an acquiring bank.

870
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,609
We have an acquiring bank and we pass through it.

871
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:57,079
We don't want to be a bank because if we were a bank,

872
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,189
then we're under all these regulations and so many people

873
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,594
from the government are asking for our seven-year plan.

874
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,674
It's hard enough coming up with a 30-day plan for a startup.

875
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,469
So, we want to resist that for as long as possible.

876
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,929
I'll get someone from the back, red shirt.

877
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,969
I guess there's a lot of red shirts in there.

878
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:23,799
My question is Square's goal to make credit cards easier to use or

879
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:26,589
do you actually eventually want to get rid of them and are aiming

880
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:31,979
for something much bigger and sort of take away credit card use?

881
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:32,939
So, the question is,

882
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,139
"Is Square's goal just to make credit cards easier to use or do

883
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,919
you want to get rid of them and go after something bigger?"

884
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:44,029
We want to make payments feel amazing.

885
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,429
We are going to make this exchange of value feel awesome.

886
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,649
Right now, everyone in this country is using this plastic device.

887
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,899
The easiest thing for us to do is build this other plastic device that

888
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,344
accepts this plastic device and then brings it in into the software.

889
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,709
And then, we have a software experience around it.

890
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,569
We want to make that feel great.

891
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:13,989
And we want to make people accounting for cash feel great as well.

892
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,269
But at the end of the day,

893
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,779
we want to constantly iterate that experience.

894
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,249
So, we don't know what that looks like in the future.

895
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:27,409
There's a lot of talk around NFC, which is near field communication,

896
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:33,764
and what that means. NFC by its very nature is just identity.

897
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,414
It's just identity and authentication. You can tie payments to it.

898
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,629
You can tie walking up to your car and unlocking to it.

899
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,559
You can tie the same thing to your house and whatnot.

900
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,654
Or you can tie like transactions to it.

901
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,959
But the thing about it is it makes the transaction easier.

902
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,419
So, if there's a mass of technology that

903
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,609
makes a transaction easier than this,

904
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,429
which everyone knows how to use, then we will accept that.

905
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,709
We will use that.

906
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:04,984
But we are not just not focused on accepting credit cards.

907
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,139
We are focused on the payment experience and all the

908
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,984
information and all the platform around payments.

909
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,639
And when you really consider it and you really consider the potential

910
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,429
of actually being able to carry the transaction end to end,

911
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:24,249
then there's a massive amount of things that you can do with it.

912
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:27,579
One swipe and you can suddenly check in to Foursquare,

913
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,079
if you have that option turned on.

914
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,909
I'm sure many of you have been to the malls,

915
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,314
where you get those little buzzers.

916
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,389
They call you back to the counter when your food is ready.

917
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,774
Why do you have to do that when you can swipe?

918
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,944
You put in your phone number for a receipt.

919
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,324
You've already used Square before, remember that.

920
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,939
They're going to send you a text message

921
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,569
when you need to go back to the counter.

922
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,919
So, there's a ton of stuff we can build hooked

923
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,039
off the transaction that's really,

924
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,729
really interesting and has never really

925
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,099
been done before in a cohesive way,

926
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:04,079
where people are building the hardware and the software.

927
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,469
That's what we're focused on.

928
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,569
It's building that cohesive story end to end.

929
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,904
With the rapid growth of Square,

930
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:20,599
how are you actually keeping the company PCI-compliant,

931
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,389
especially with all the wireless transmission of the data,

932
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,493
which contains credit card?

933
00:53:24,692 --> 00:53:27,837
And this second card question to that,

934
00:53:28,037 --> 00:53:29,235
your merchant account does fine.

935
00:53:29,335 --> 00:53:31,276
But with the clearing house, how is that?

936
00:53:32,552 --> 00:53:37,439
So, the questions are, "With the rapid growth of Square,

937
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,914
how are you keeping the company PCI-compliant?"

938
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:43,379
which is a compliance we have to go under as a financial institution.

939
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,159
And then, "Without the merchant account, how are you doing?"

940
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,589
The clearing house, you all know it as a direct deposit.

941
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:55,499
It's also called ACH. So, PCI compliance is very interesting.

942
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,459
You have all these auditors come in and they

943
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,454
audit new lines of code and your practices,

944
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,879
the cryptography you use and everything.

945
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,489
So, we encrypt as soon as it comes off the reader.

946
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,899
It's encrypted with our server's public key

947
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,044
it had sent up through encrypted channels.

948
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,309
And then, it's decrypted and then sent off to the processors and

949
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:23,199
the banks and the whole chain of the credit card industry,

950
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,299
which would take another hour to describe.

951
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:31,139
But the way that we have made sure that we're always compliant

952
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,734
is we do a lot of what's called paraprogramming in Square.

953
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,234
We have two people at one computer, two keyboards, two mice.

954
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:43,359
And you have two people working on the same problem.

955
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,129
You have two eyes on every line of code,

956
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,219
which happens to be one of the requirements for PCI

957
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,139
compliance but something we just do naturally.

958
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,489
So, we have a lot of folks who know exactly

959
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:58,244
what's happening in the system, who can encourage best practices.

960
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:04,369
We were the fastest through our PCI audit

961
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:07,689
that our auditor ever went through.

962
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,244
The other thing that's happening with PCI

963
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,744
is it's evolving very, very quickly.

964
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:17,479
PCI was not written for mobile and it has to be rewritten for mobile.

965
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,109
So, everything is in a gray area right now.

966
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,919
There's going to be a lot of changes.

967
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,299
And I think Square is going to inform a lot of these changes

968
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,599
because I believe that a lot of our practices,

969
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,969
our security practices and our safety practices,

970
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,539
are better than what PCI mandates.

971
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:38,939
We are engineers and we want to engineer a precise

972
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,859
and safe and secure system from end to end.

973
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,299
It goes back to that detail point.

974
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:46,139
We want every single detail to be perfect.

975
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,739
A lot of these committees and auditors

976
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,484
don't have the same source of ideas.

977
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:58,649
On the clearing house side, what it means by that is I can accept the

978
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,429
credit card but how do I get the money?

979
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,379
So, you get the money by you download the application.

980
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,564
You put in your address.

981
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:07,759
We send you a Square in two to three days for free.

982
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:11,419
And then, you take someone's money. You take $50 from them.

983
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:12,889
And then, you need to get the money out.

984
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:18,039
What you do is you go to the bottom of the check book or on your online

985
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,669
banking and you get the routing number and the account number.

986
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,749
You put in your bank account information.

987
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:28,639
We send a test transaction, which is two micro transactions.

988
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,014
And then, you verify that that is actually yours.

989
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,319
And then, we start funneling the money to you every single night.

990
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,994
So, the clearing house function is we're just telling

991
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,544
all the money goes into a bank account,

992
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,519
which is owned by our acquiring bank.

993
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:44,079
Then, when we have the information,

994
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,959
we tell that bank to send this amount to this bank account,

995
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,279
which is the bank account that you put in.

996
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,619
So, that means that we don't have to be under

997
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,514
the same regulations that the banks do. They can handle all that.

998
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,629
We don't have a need for any money transfer license

999
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,809
because we're not crossing state lines, the bank is.

1000
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:06,019
We're just telling the bank to send this money from A to B.

1001
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,929
So, that's how it technically works.

1002
00:57:11,288 --> 00:57:13,109
You talked about two major pain point problems

1003
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,409
that you managed to solve through your solution,

1004
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:18,989
one of them real-time communication and the other one payment

1005
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,394
processing and really customer relationship management.

1006
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,109
Are there any other pain point, problems that you know of but don't

1007
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:29,339
really have the time to solve that, or don't want to solve?

1008
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:33,279
That's a great question. There's a lot of pain points in the company.

1009
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,099
So, we'd love to have you join the company.

1010
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,319
Yeah, there's going to be a lot.

1011
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,889
I think of Square as a platform that's

1012
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:47,199
going to build an ecosystem around it.

1013
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:52,664
We're going to be very, very good about releasing strong and

1014
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,169
clear APIs on how to build things.

1015
00:57:55,370 --> 00:58:03,139
The best thing that you can do is hook something off that payment.

1016
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,639
A real-time hook off that payment goes

1017
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,319
back to that sort of visualization.

1018
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,219
I would just love to see a visualization of all

1019
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,909
commerce happening in the world right now.

1020
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,549
Can you imagine a visualization of money

1021
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:18,289
flowing from one place to another place, what that looks like?

1022
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:23,039
That's awesome. So, I'd love to see projects like that.

1023
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,439
We're certainly not going to think about all of them.

1024
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:31,329
But we are going to think about a lot of them.

1025
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,359
We are going to do a lot.

1026
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,099
The company right now is already doing about eight different things.

1027
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,439
We have to coordinate all those eight

1028
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,014
different things into one thing.

1029
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,349
We're building hardware. We're fulfilling hardware.

1030
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,229
We're building a payment network that

1031
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,269
can't go down because if we go down,

1032
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,368
we lose money for one of our users.

1033
00:58:49,352 --> 00:58:51,299
It's not just 140 characters,

1034
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,594
it's potentially $140 because they can't make the sale.

1035
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,669
We're building a risk and fraud function. We're building support.

1036
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,749
And then, we're building Web service and a client.

1037
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,749
So, there's a lot going on and there's going to be even more.

1038
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,014
I think of Square as a startup with many startups inside of it.

1039
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,539
That's how we're organizing the company internally.

1040
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,759
We're going to have a lot of different projects.

1041
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:19,909
They'll be coordinated by this one cohesive unit outside.

1042
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,939
Jack, with that, we have to call the event to a close.

1043
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,124
The business associates and the staff and I...

1044
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,769
On behalf of DFJ and Bases,

1045
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,435
we want to thank you for your talk today and give you this trophy.

1046
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,081
Thank you very much.
